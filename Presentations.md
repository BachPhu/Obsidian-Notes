# Slide 1
Hi, my name is Le Vi Pham and my presentation is about the issues with STEM online education and my proposal solution to this issue.

# The Problem
- So, the problem with STEM online education is that many student reported to be unsatisfied with their course experience. This chart is from a national survey about undergraduate experience with the switch to online learning because of the COVID-19 pandemic, they have a sample number of 1008 participants.
- As you can see, the data shows that 57% percent students thinks that they have less motivation while taking online course than in person

- Another issue with STEM online courses is the lack of hand-on experience for students. For example: labs, problem-solving activity (like the hackathon), workshops, etc..

- Lack of connection, this could be connection with instructors or peer to peer connection. Normally, when you're in F2F, you can come to your professor's office hours or ask them quick question before/after classes, but you don't have that many chances in online courses as shown on the chart, 65% student find it harder to collaborate with others student on course work. Same thing with peers connection, it's easier to make friends and share knowledge, struggle while in-person. So, you're kinda by yourself throughout the entire learning process.

- Again, online students don't get to interact with their professors that often, and visa versa, which make it harder for student to get regular personal feedback on their strengths and weaknesses

# The Cause
The main cause for those issues is communication issues within parties involved, that could be  between the institution and instructors, instructors to student or student and institution. 

- Unclear course planning, or unclear expectation can confuse student. Some student might underestimate or overestimate the expected effort of an assignment, which could lead them to having a bad grade or burnout quickly. Some instructors can also underestimated the workload that they assigned to student, this can also make it hard for student to keep their interest to the course material when they're just overwhelm with assignments.  

- There could be technical struggle for instructors if the institution didn't provide enough guideline, same thing for students. It can also be internet connection issues that interrupt the learning process

- Time and location is also another factor. 
	- It's harder for student to ask questions during an online meeting as some professor explain material really fast. While in-class, they could raise their hand and ask without it feel like interrupting the whole class. The answers during online lessons can be really general or vague when the instructor try to move to
