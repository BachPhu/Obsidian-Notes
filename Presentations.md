# Proposal
AI- cooperate feedback and adjustment for each student
Provide external sources such youtube videos (OG Chem, Khan Academy, )

Support Example: KhanAcademy


# Slide 1
Hi, my name is Le Vi Pham and my presentation is about the issues with STEM online education and my proposal solution to this issue.

# The Problem
- So, the problem with STEM online education is that many student reported to be unsatisfied with their course experience. This chart is from a national survey about undergraduate experience with the switch to online learning because of the COVID-19 pandemic, they have a sample number of 1008 participants.
- As you can see, the data shows that 57% percent students thinks that they have less motivation while taking online course than in person

- Another issue with STEM online courses is the lack of hand-on experience for students. For example: labs, problem-solving activity (like the hackathon), workshops, etc..

- Lack of connection, this could be connection with instructors or peer to peer connection. Normally, when you're in F2F, you can come to your professor's office hours or ask them quick question before/after classes, but you don't have that many chances in online courses as shown on the chart, 65% student find it harder to collaborate with others student on course work. Same thing with peers connection, it's easier to make friends and share knowledge, struggle while in-person. So, you're kinda by yourself throughout the entire learning process.

- Again, online students don't get to interact with their professors that often, and visa versa, which make it harder for student to get regular personal feedback on their strengths and weaknesses

# The Cause
The main cause for those issues is communication issues within parties involved, that could be  between the institution and instructors, instructors to student or student and institution. 

- Unclear course planning, or unclear expectation can confuse student. Some student might underestimate or overestimate the expected effort of an assignment, which could lead them to having a bad grade or burnout quickly. Some instructors can also underestimated the workload that they assigned to student, this can also make it hard for student to keep their interest to the course material when they're just overwhelm with assignments.  

- There could be technical struggle for instructors if the institution didn't provide enough guideline, same thing for students. It can also be internet connection issues that interrupt the learning process

- Time and location is also another factor. 
	- It's harder for student to ask questions in the right time for an online meeting. and The answers can be really general or vague when the instructor already move past that material. While student have flexible option for where they want to study, it can be a little distracting sometimes compare to an actual classroom. Compare to in-class, student could raise their hand and ask without it feel like interrupting the whole class and get others involve in the discussion too. 

# Why does it matterâ€‹

This issue matter because poor online course experience it can affect student's learning outcome quality. Which doesn't bring a good name to STEM online education landscape and can drive people away from pursuing STEM degrees. In long term, bad learning outcome quality can also affect future STEM industry, which is a very big part of our world now and in the future. 

And finally, to prepare for scenario where the the education landscape have to go fully remote again due to pandemic


# Proposal Solution
## Adaptive course design
My proposal solution for this issue is to have an adaptive design for online STEM courses.
- Bullet 1: external sources can be videos, articles, educational sites, or alternative methods.
- Bulelt 3: again, we could use the help of ai for this too. 

The closest model to this proposal idea that I could find is Khan Academy, they're famous for their mathematical teaching method. They are using most of these points, have show effective results and is widely use for e-learning.


# Justification and Feasibility
The cost for an custom AI software depend on its complexity level. A low-level complexity AI software would cost around ... A medium complexity would be around ... And the maintenance cost is around...

- Some potential resistance would be: the fact that not everyone one agree with using AI, this could ve due to them misunderstanding the purpose/goal of the this idea AI. Some might worry that AI might takeover their job position. It can also be overwhelming for both instructor and student the first few times.

- Here my explanation, having an AI assistant can reduce a lot of frustration for both instructors and students. Student will get the extra resources they needed which can save a lot of time instructor. Of course, student can always reach out to their instructors if they have more specific questions. It's simply more productive and save more time. With the issue that some ppl worry that AI can replace them, I highly doubt that would happens anytime soon. While the AI is smart, but it's not perfect and students still need instructors to understand the course's material
- Another benefit is that the course design quality improvement will become more consistent with the AI collecting feedback and organize them regular
- The price seems high but that is for one software/system, so if we use it widely across many institution then the price is actually not bad at all
