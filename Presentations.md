# Slide 1
Hi, my name is Le Vi Pham and my presentation is about the issues with STEM online education and my proposal solution to this issue.

# The Problem
- So, the problem with STEM online education is that many student reported to be unsatisfied with their course experience. This chart is from a national survey about undergraduate experience with the switch to online learning because of the COVID-19 pandemic, they have a sample number of 1008 participants.
- As you can see, the data shows that 57% percent students thinks that they have less motivation while taking online course than in person

- Another issue with STEM online courses is the lack of hand-on experience for students. For example: labs, problem-solving activity (like the hackathon), workshops, etc..

- Lack of connection, this could be connection with instructors or peer to peer connection. Normally, when you're in F2F, you can come to your professor's office hours or ask them quick question before/after classes, but you don't have that many chances in online courses as shown on the chart, 65% student find it harder to collaborate with others student on course work. Same thing with peers connection, it's easier to make friends and share knowledge, struggle while in-person. So, you're kinda by yourself throughout the entire learning process.

- Again, online students don't get to interact with their professors that often, and visa versa, which make it harder for student to get regular personal feedback on their strengths and weaknesses
