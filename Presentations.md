# Slide 1
Hi, my name is Le Vi Pham and my presentation is about the issues with STEM online education and my proposal solution to this issue.

# The Problem
- So, the problem with STEM online education is that many student reported to be unsatisfied with their course experience. This chart is from a national survey about undergraduate experience with the switch to online learning because of the COVID-19 pandemic, they have a sample number of 1008 participants.
- As you can see, the data shows that 57% percent students thinks that they have less motivation while taking online course than in person
- Lack of connection, this could be connection with instructors or peer to peer connection. Normally, when you're in F2F, you can come to your professor's office hours or ask them quick question before/after classes, but you don't have that many chances in online courses. Same thing with peers connection, while in-person, it's easier to make friends and share knowledge
