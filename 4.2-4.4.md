> [!Objective]
> 4.2.1 Predict whether a compound is soluble or insoluble in water.  
> 4.2.2 Predict whether a precipitation reaction will occur when two aqueous solutions are mixed.  
> 4.2.3 Write balanced chemical equations including phases for metathesis reactions.  
> 4.2.4 Convert balanced molecular equations into full and net ionic equations

Precipitation Reaction occurs when two aqueous solutions (solutions with soluble salts) are mixed, and an insoluble salt, precipitate separates from the solution  
• Precipitate: Insoluble solid

## Solubility of Ionic Compounds
Not all ionic compounds totally dissolve in water.  
• Solubility of ionic compounds varies greatly, and differences depend on:  
▪ Relative attraction of ions for each other  
▪ Attraction of ions for water molecules  

Example  
Sodium chloride is quite soluble in water, whereas silver chloride, which contains  
Ag+ and Cl– ions, is only slightly soluble  
• Predicting whether a compound will dissolve in water is done by empirical method.  
• A list of solubility rules is used to decide what combination of ions will dissolve.  

###  [[Solubility Rules]]
given two compound, one of them must be precipitate by crossing ionic. reaction happen(if there're two precipitate then no reaction happens)


net ion is the one that change while spectator ion is the one that didnt change
