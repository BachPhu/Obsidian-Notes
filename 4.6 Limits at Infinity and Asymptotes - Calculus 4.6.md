#### Limits at Infinity and Asymptote
If $\lim_{x → ∞ } f(x) = L$ or  $\lim_{x → -∞ } f(x) = L$, the line y = L is a **horizontal asymptote** of f.

#### End Behavior

The behavior of a function f(x) as x → $\pm  ∞$ is called the function's **end behavior**

> [!NOTE]
> Three Possibilities:
> 1. The function f(x) approaches a infinite value L
> 2. f(x) → ∞ or f(x) → - ∞
> 3. Neither 1 nor 2 holds, f(x) has oscillatory behavior

##### End Behavior of Polynomial Functions
Consider the power function f(x) = $x^n$, where n is a positive integer

n Even: 

$\lim_{x → ∞} x^{n} = ∞$
$\lim_{x → -∞} x^{n} = ∞$

n Odd:
$\lim_{x → ∞} x^{n} = ∞$
$\lim_{x → -∞} x^{n} = -∞$
