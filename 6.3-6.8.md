# 6.3 Line Spectra and the Bohr Model  

> [!Objective]
>
> - 6.3.1 Explain the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom and use it to account for the line spectrum of hydrogen.  
> - 6.3.2 Use the Bohr model to calculate the wavelengths (or frequencies) of light hat can either be absorbed or emitted by the hydrogen atom.

**Continuous spectrum**: Results when white light is passed through a prism  
▪ Contains all the wavelengths of visible light

**Line spectrum**: Shows only certain discrete  wavelengths  
▪ Each element has a unique line spectrum.

## The Hydrogen Spectrum

- Johann Balmer (1885) discovered a simple formula relating the four emission lines to integers.  
- Johannes Rydberg advanced this formula.  
($R_{H}$ is called the Rydberg constant.)  
- Neils Bohr explained why this mathematical relationship works.  

$$\frac{1}{\lambda} = R_{H}(\frac{1}{n^{2}_{1}}-\frac{1}{n^2_{2}})$$
$$𝑅_{H} = 1.0974 × 10^{7}m^{−1} = 1.0974 × 10^{−2}nm^{−1}$$

## Bohr’s Hydrogen Atom

Niels Bohr(1885–1962) - using Planck’s  
assumption:  
1) Only orbits of certain radii, with specific energies are allowed for the electron in a hydrogen atom .  
- that means the energy ($E_n$) was  
_quantized_.  
2) **Quantum model**: The electron in a  hydrogen atom moves around the nucleus only in the “allowed” energy  level (energy state).  
3) These orbits are at a fixed distance from the nucleus- stationary states
4) An electron in an allowed energy state does not radiate energy, and, therefore, does not spiral into the nucleus.  
5) Energy is emitted or absorbed by the electron only as the electron changes from one energy state to another. This energy is emitted or absorbed as a photon that has energy,  $E=hv$
6) Electrons in the lowest energy state are in the _ground state, n = 1_. Any energy higher is called an _excited state, n > 1_ 
- Since each orbit has a specific value compared to RH, transitions from one energy level to another can be calculated:
$$\Delta E = E_{f} - E{i} = (-2.18 \times 10^{-18}J)(\frac{1}{n^{2}_{1}}-\frac{1}{n^2_{2}})$$

$$\Delta E = h\frac{c}{\lambda } $$
or 
$$\lambda = \frac{hc}{\Delta E}$$

## Energy State Values

- A positive ΔE means energy is absorbed. A photon is absorbed in this instance.  $n_{f}>n_{i}$

- A negative ΔE means energy is released. A photon is emitted in this instance.  $n_{f}<n_{i}$

## Bohr’s Model - Conclusions

- Correctly fits the quantized energy levels of the hydrogen atom  
- Postulates only certain allowed circular orbits for the electron  
- Energy is involved in the transition of an electron from one level to another

Draw Backs:

This model only works for hydrogen (one electron).  
▪ It does not account for electron–electron interactions in atoms with more than  
one electron.  
▪ Electrons have wave-like properties that must be accommodated.
