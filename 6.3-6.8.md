> - 6.3.1 Explain the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom and use it to account for the line spectrum of hydrogen.  
> - 6.3.2 Use the Bohr model to calculate the wavelengths (or frequencies) of light hat can either be absorbed or emitted by the hydrogen atom.

**Continuous spectrum**: Results when white light is passed through a prism  
▪ Contains all the wavelengths of visible light

**Line spectrum**: Shows only certain discrete  wavelengths  
▪ Each element has a unique line spectrum.

## The Hydrogen Spectrum

- Johann Balmer (1885) discovered a simple formula relating the four emission lines to integers.  
- Johannes Rydberg advanced this formula.  
($R_{H}$ is called the Rydberg constant.)  
- Neils Bohr explained why this mathematical relationship works.  

$$\frac{1}{\lambda} = R_{H}(\frac{1}{n^{2}_{1}}-\frac{1}{n^2_{2}})$$
$$𝑅_{H} = 1.0974 × 10^{7}m^{−1} = 1.0974 × 10^{−2}nm^{−1}$$

## Bohr’s Hydrogen Atom

Niels Bohr(1885–1962) - using Planck’s  
assumption:  
1) Only orbits of certain radii, with specific energies are allowed for the electron in a hydrogen atom .  
- that means the energy ($E_n$) was  
_quantized_.  
2) **Quantum model**: The electron in a  hydrogen atom moves around the nucleus only in the “allowed” energy  level (energy state).  
3) These orbits are at a fixed distance from the nucleus- stationary states
4) An electron in an allowed energy state does not radiate energy, and, therefore, does not spiral into the nucleus.  
5) Energy is emitted or absorbed by the electron only as the electron changes from one energy state to another. This energy is emitted or absorbed as a photon that has energy,  $E=hv$
6) Electrons in the lowest energy state are in the _ground state, n = 1_. Any energy higher is called an _excited state, n > 1_ 
- Since each orbit has a specific value compared to RH, transitions from one energy level to another can be calculated:
$$\Delta E = E_{f} - E{i} = (-2.18 \times 10^{-18}J)(\frac{1}{n^{2}_{1}}-\frac{1}{n^2_{2}})$$

$$\Delta E = h\frac{c}{\lambda } $$
or 
$$\lambda = \frac{hc}{\Delta E}$$

---

## Energy State Values

- A positive ΔE means energy is absorbed. A photon is absorbed in this instance.  $n_{f}>n_{i}$

- A negative ΔE means energy is released. A photon is emitted in this instance.  $n_{f}<n_{i}$
---

## Bohr’s Model - Conclusions

- Correctly fits the quantized energy levels of the hydrogen atom  
- Postulates only certain allowed circular orbits for the electron  
- Energy is involved in the transition of an electron from one level to another

Draw Backs:

This model only works for hydrogen (one electron).  
▪ It does not account for electron–electron interactions in atoms with more than  
one electron.  
▪ Electrons have wave-like properties that must be accommodated.

# 6.4 The Wave Behavior of Matter: Dual Nature of Light

Electromagnetic radiation exhibits wave and particulate properties  
Louis de Broglie equation:

$$\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}$$

> [!NOTE]
> Unit: 
> h = $6.626×10^{–34}$ J · s  
> Since 1 J = 1 kg · $m^2/s^2$  
> h = $6.626×10^{–34}$ kg · $m^2$/s

## Diffraction

- Bending of wave around the corner of an obstacle
- Scattered radiation produces a _diffraction pattern_ of bright spots and dark areas on a photographic plate  
	 Diffraction pattern can be explained only in terms of waves

## Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle

- Heisenberg proposed the dual nature of matter (particle and wave) placed a limitation on how precisely we can know both momentum and position.  
- Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that one cannot simultaneously know the exact position and the exact momentum of an electron.  
- The wave and particle nature of the electron are _complementary properties_.  
- The more precisely the momentum of a particle is known, the less precisely its position is known
$$(\Delta x) (\Delta mv) \ge \frac{h}{4 \pi}$$

# 6.5 The Quantum mechanical Model of atom

## Wave Mechanics in Hydrogen
- Erwin Schrödinger developed a  
mathematical treatment into  
which both the wave and particle  
nature of matter could be  
incorporated.  
▪ This is known as quantum  
mechanics

## Quantum Mechanics and Atomic Orbitals

- The solution of Schrödinger’s wave equation for hydrogen yields _wave functions_ (ψ) for the electron.  
-  The square of the wave function ($ψ^2$) gives the _electron density_ or _probability density_ of where an electron is likely to be at any given  time an is called ‘_orbital_’.  
	electron’s location when it is in an allowed energy state.  
▪ Orbitals are three-dimensional regions of space with distinctive shapes, orientations, and average distances from the nucleus.

### Orbitals and Quantum Numbers

▪ Each different atomic orbital is characterized by a set of numbers called _quantum numbers_.  
▪ It is a unique combination of three integers.

> [!NOTE]
> - These numbers define the size, shape, and orientation of orbitals and the allowed energies of electrons.  
> 	- Magnetic quantum number ($m_l$)
> 	- Principal quantum number (n)  
> 	- Angular momentum quantum number (l)

#### Principal Quantum Number (n)

- The principal quantum number, n, describes the size and energy of an orbital or a group of orbitals in an atom  
- As n increases, the orbitals become larger, and the electron spends more time farther away from the nucleus.  
 - As n increases the electron also has a higher energy and is less tightly bound to the nucleus.

#### Angular Momentum Quantum Number (l)

- l (_subshell_): Has integral values from 0 to (n – 1) for each value of n  
▪ Defines the shape of atomic orbitals  
▪ Value of l for each orbital is assigned a letter : s, p, d, f, ...  
▪ Each set of orbitals is designated by giving the value of n and the letter for l  
▪ Orbitals with the same value of n and l are in the same subshell and have the same energy.

#### Magnetic Quantum Number ($m_{l}$)

Defines the orientation of an orbital in space relative to the other orbitals in the atom  
▪ Has integral values between -l and +l Includes zero  $-l \le m_{l} \le l$ 
▪ Gives the number of orbitals in each subshell and in turn in each energy level

s subshell: If l = 0 then $m_{l}$ will be 0
p subshell : If l=1 then $m_l$ will be −1, 0, +1
d subshell : If l = 2 then $m_l$ = −2, − 1, 0, +1, +2
f subshell : If l = 3 then $m_l$ = -3, −2, − 1, 0, +1, +2, +3
