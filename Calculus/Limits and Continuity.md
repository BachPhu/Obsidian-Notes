# Limit Existence Theorem

$$\sum\limits_{x -> a} f(x) $$



	WARNING 1: -> means “approaches.” Avoid using this symbol outside the context of limits.
	WARNING 2: Sometimes, the limit value lim x  a f x( ) does not equal the function value f a( )
	WARNING 3: Do not omit the limit operator lim x 1 until this substitution phase.
