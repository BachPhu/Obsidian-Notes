# Connection between f(x), f'(x) and f''(x)


| If f'(x)| Then f(x)|
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| is = 0 or undefined is x = a | has a potential relative max or min |
| is > 0                       | is increasing                       |
| is < 0                       | is decreasing                       |
| changes from pos to neg      | has a rel max                       |
| changes from neg to pos      | has a rel min                       |



| If f''(x)                    | Then f(x)                           |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| is = 0 or undefined is x = a | has a potential point of inflection |
| is > 0                       | is concave up                       |
| is < 0                       | is concave down                     |
| changes from pos to neg      | has a point of inflection           |
| changes from neg to pos      | has a point of inflection           |
