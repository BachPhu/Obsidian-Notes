# Periodic Trends in Atomic Properties

- Atomic radius
- Ionization energy
- Electron affinity

# 7.3 Atomic Radii  
• Obtained by measuring the distance between atoms in a chemical compound  
• **van der Waals radius** = _nonbonding atomic radius_ , is half of the shortest distance separating two nuclei  
• **covalent radius** = _bonding atomic radius_, is half the distance between nuclei in a bond.

## Bonding Atomic Radius

The bonding atomic radius tends to  
- decrease from left to right across a period  ($Z_{eff}$ ↑)
- increase from top to bottom of a group ($n$ ↑ )

### Trends in Atomic Radius

- Atomic radius increases down a group($n$ ↑ )
$r_{F} < r_{Cl} < r_{Br} < r_{I} < r_{At}$
- Caused by the increase in orbital sizes in successive principal quantum levels which decreases effective nuclear charge

- Atomic radius decreases in going across a period from left to right
$r_{Na} > r_{Mg} > r_{Al} > r_Si > r_P > r_S > r_{Cl} >r_{Ar}$
- Caused owing to increasing effective nuclear charge while going from left to right. Valence electrons are closer to the nucleus, which decreases the size of the atom

## Sizes of Ions—Ionic Radii

- Determined by interatomic distances in ionic compounds  
- Ionic size depends on  
	- the nuclear charge  
	- the number of electrons;  
	- the orbitals in which valence electrons reside

Cations  
• Much smaller than parent atoms  
• The outermost electron(s) is/are removed and repulsions between electrons are reduced.  

Anions  
• Much larger the parent atoms  
• repulsions between electrons are increased due to added electrons.  


• Ionic radius is determined by interatomic distances in ionic compounds

## Isoelectronic Series and Ion Size

- In an _isoelectronic series_, ions have the same number of electrons.  
- Ionic size decreases with an increasing nuclear charge.  
- An isoelectronic series example (Neon—10 electrons)  
- Also note the increasing nuclear charge with decreasing ionic radius as atomic number increases
# 7.4 Ionization Energy

Energy required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom or ion (or 1 mole of e- from one mole of gas-phase atoms)
$$X(g) → X^{+}(g) + e^{-}$$

- _First ionization energy_ ($l_1$): Energy required to remove the highest-energy electron of an atom
- Second ionization energy ($l_2$)  
• Value of $l_1$ is smaller than that of the _second ionization energy_ ($l_2$)

The higher the ionization energy, the more difficult it is to remove an electron. You are removing a negative particle from a positive ion

$$Mg(g) → Mg^{+}(g) + e^{-} \text{ \>\>\>\>} IE_{1}$$$$Mg^{+}(g) → Mg^{2+}(g) + e^{-} \text{ \>\>\>\>} IE_{2}$$

## Ionization Energy

- More energy is required to remove each successive electron.  
- When all valence electrons have been removed, it takes a great deal more energy to remove the next electron (a core electron)

## Periodic Trends for the First Ionization Energy ($I_1$)

1) I1 generally, increases across a period.  
2) I1 generally, decreases down a group.  
3) The s- and p-block elements show a larger range of values for I1. (The d-block generally increases slowly across the period; the f-block elements show only small variations.)

## Factors That Influence Ionization Energy  
• Smaller atoms have higher I values.  
• I values depend on effective nuclear charge and average distance of the electron from the nucleus.

## Ionization Energy Trends in the Periodic Table

![[Screen Shot 2023-12-10 at 2.30.54 PM.png]]
- valence electron in the next element enters a new sublevel (higher energy sublevel)  
- is the first electron to pair in one orbital of the sublevel (electron repulsions lower energy)
### Explain:

- [?] The first ionization energy for phosphorus is 1060 kJ/mol, and that for sulphur is 1005  
kJ/mol. Why?  

- [s] Solution  
▪ Phosphorus and sulfur are neighbouring elements in Period 3 of the periodic table  
and have the following valence electron configurations:  
▪ Phosphorus is 3s23p3  
▪ Sulfur is 3s23p4  
▪ Ordinarily, the first ionization energy increases as we go across a period, so we  
might expect sulphur to have a greater ionization energy than phosphorus  
▪ However, in this case the fourth p electron in sulphur must be placed in an  
already occupied orbital  
▪ The electron–electron repulsions that result cause this electron to be more  
easily removed than might be expected

# 7.4 Electron Affinity (EA)

- __Electron affinity__ is the energy change associated with the addition of an electron to a gaseous atom  
• It is typically _exothermic_, so, for most elements, it is negative

## General Trend in Electron Affinity (EA)

As we go across a period from left to right, electron affinity increases.  
• More negative the energy, greater the quantity of energy released  
• _Three_ notable exceptions include the following:  
1) Group 2A: s sublevel is full.  
2) Group 5A: p sublevel is half-full.  
3) Group 8A: p sublevel is full.  

- Note: The electron affinity for many of these elements is _positive_ (*$X^{-}$ is unstable*)

## EA values:

- Becomes more positive as we go down a group when  
	- Electrons are added at increasing distances from the nucleus  
	- Changes are relatively small
