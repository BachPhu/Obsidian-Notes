# 5.1 Forces

**Kinematics**: The study of motion is called kinematics, but kinematics only describes the way objects move—their velocity and their acceleration.
**Dynamics** is the study of how forces affect the motion of objects and systems. It considers the causes of motion of objects and systems of interest, where a system is anything being analyzed.

We can define **force** as the push or pull on an object with a specific magnitude and direction (therefore, it is a vector quantity)

The SI unit of force is called the newton (abbreviated N)
$$\text{1 N = 1 kg} \cdot m / s^{2}$$

## Contact forces

Contact forces also result from fundamental interaction and occur when there is direct contact between two objects:
- the *normal force* is the force that a surface of an object will push back with,
- the *force of tension* redirects an applied force to another position,
- the *spring force* will pull a spring back toward an equilibrium position, 
- the frictional force is a force that opposes motion.

The spring force follows Hooke’s law, which states
$$F_{x}= -k(x - x_{0})$$
where $x_{0}$ is the equilibrium length

## Newton’s Laws of Motion

_Newton’s First Law_ states that the velocity of an object will remain unchanged unless it is acted on by a net external force.
 $$\vec{v} \text{ = constant when  } \vec{F}_{net} = \text{0 N}$$

_Newton’s Second Law_ states that the sum of all forces acting on an object is equal to the mass times acceleration of that object

The acceleration of a system is directly proportional to and in the same direction as the net external force acting on the system and is inversely proportion to its mass.
$$F_{net}= F = ma$$
Newton’s Second Law and Momentum

The instantaneous rate at which a body’s momentum changes is equal to the net force acting on the body.
