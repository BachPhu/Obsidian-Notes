5.1 Forces

Kinematics: The study of motion is called kinematics, but kinematics only describes the way objects move—their velocity and their acceleration.
Dynamics is the study of how forces affect the motion of objects and systems. It considers the causes of motion of objects and systems of interest, where a system is anything being analyzed.

---
Newton’s First Law states that the velocity of an object will remain unchanged unless it is acted on by a net external force.

---
Newton’s Second Law states that the sum of all forces acting on an object is equal to the mass times acceleration of that object
$$F_{net}= F = ma$$
Newton’s Second Law and Momentum

---
The instantaneous rate at which a body’s momentum changes is equal to the net force acting on the body.
