single bond - 1 sigma
double- 1 sigma 1 pi
triple - 2 pi 1 sigma

# 9.1 Molecular Shapes  
• Lewis structures show bonding and lone pairs but do not denote shape.  
• However, Lewis structures help determine shapes.  
• Here are some common shapes for molecules with two or three atoms  
connected to a central atom.

# 9.2 Valence Shell Electron-Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) Model 

- [?] What determines the shape of a molecule?  
- The bond angles and bond lengths determine the shape and also the size of molecules.  
- **Valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory** is a simple model that allows us to account for molecular shape.  
- Properties of molecular substances depend on the structure of the molecule.  
- **Molecular structure**:  Three-dimensional arrangement of molecules in an atom
---

- Main postulate  
- Structure around a given atom is determined by minimizing electron-pair  
repulsions  
- Bonding and nonbonding pairs around a given atom will be placed as far  
apart as possible  
- _Electron domains_ (groups) are defined as lone pairs, single bonds, double bonds, and triple bonds

---
## Electron Group Geometry or Electron-Domain Geometries  
- There are five basic arrangements of electron groups around a central atom.  
	- Based on a maximum of six bonding electron groups  
	- Though there may be more than six on very large atoms, it is very rare.  
- Each of these five basic arrangements results in five different basic electron  
geometries.  
- To determine the electron-domain geometry, count the total number of bonding (single,  
double, and triple bonds) and nonbonding (lone pairs) electron domains on the central  
atom.  
- Multiple bonds count as _One_ electron domain

## Applying V S E P R to Determine Molecular Shapes

1) Draw the best Lewis structure.  
2) Determine the electron-domain geometry.  
3) Use the arrangement of the bonded atoms to determine the molecular geometry. (Bonding domains)
## Predicting the Shapes of Larger Molecules With Multiple Central  Atoms

1. Draw the Lewis structure  
2. Determine the number of electron groups around each central atom  
3. Classify each electron group as bonding or lone pair, and count each type remember, multiple bonds count as one group  
4. Determine the geometry about each atom

# 9.3 Molecular Shape and Polarity  

- Use what you know about polarity of individual bonds (based on electronegativity)  
to assign dipole moment:  
	- Think: vectors (magnitude and direction).  
	- Polar: bond dipoles are not symmetrical.  
	- Nonpolar: bond dipoles cancel, i.e., equal and/or arranged symmetrically around the center. 

1. Draw the Lewis structure.  
2. Count central atom e- pairs to determine the e- domain geometry.  
3. Distinguish between bonding and nonbonding electron domains to determine molecular geometry. (Use tables as your guide)
