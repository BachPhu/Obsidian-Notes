# 7.1 Work

Work done (energy given) by a constant force on an object is equal to the component of the force in that direction times the displacement:
$$W = F_{x}\Delta x$$
$$W = F\Delta \vec{r}$$
- This can be positive or negative, and will have the result of either speeding up or slowing down the object.
