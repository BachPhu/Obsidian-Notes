# 7.1 Work

Work done (energy given) by a constant force on an object is equal to the component of the force in that direction times the displacement:
$$W = F_{x}\Delta x$$
$$W = F\Delta \vec{r}$$
- This can be positive or negative, and will have the result of either speeding up or slowing down the object.

# 7.2 Kinetic Energy

- The kinetic energy is the energy associated with motion that is always positive:
$$K = \frac{1}{2} mv^{2}$$
- The kinetic energy of a particle can be expressed in terms of its mass and momentum: 
$$\vec{P} = m\vec{v}$$
$$K = \frac{1}{2} mv^{2} = \frac{1}{2}m \frac{P^2}{m^2}$$
$$K = \frac{P^2}{2m}$$

- Work and kinetic energy have units of energy which are often either joules:
	- 1 J = 1 N m, for large objects or electron volts,
	- 1 eV = 1.602 Ã— 10-19 J, for small objects.
# 7.3 Work-Energy Theorem

The work-kinetic energy theorem therefore states that the change in kinetic energy is related to the net force and the path of motion:
$$\Delta K = K_{f} - K_{i} = W_{net}$$
When calculating the net work, you must include all the forces that act on an object.

According to this theorem, when an object slows down, its final kinetic energy is less than its initial kinetic energy, the change in its kinetic energy is negative, and so is the net work done on it. If an object speeds up, the net work done on it is positive.
