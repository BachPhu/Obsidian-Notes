# Hybridization and the Localized Electron Model

- Valence Bond Theory :Describe the formation of covalent bonds in terms of atomic orbital overlap  
 - Hybrid Orbitals  
- Define and give examples of σ and π bonds  
- Molecules with Multiple “Central” Atoms  
- Recognition of hybridization of the atoms in the given molecule

# 9.4 Covalent Bonding and Orbital Overlap

- [?] How can we use atomic orbitals to explain bonding and to  
account for molecular geometries? 
- VSEPR does not explain why bonds exist.  
- The marriage of Lewis’s notion of electron-pair bonds and the idea of atomic orbitals leads to a model of chemical bonding, called _valence-bond theory_

Valence Bond theory (VB) approaches chemical bonding based on an extension of the quantum-mechanical model.  
▪ In valence-bond theory, electrons of two atoms occupy the  
same space.  
▪ This is called “overlap” of orbitals.  
▪ The sharing of space between two electrons of opposite spin  
results in a covalent bond.  
▪ Bonding electron pairs are concentrated in the regions between  
atoms. and nonbonding electron pairs lie in directed regions of  
space away from the bonds
