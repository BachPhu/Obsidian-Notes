- Recognition of hybridization of the atoms in the given molecule

# 9.4 Covalent Bonding and Orbital Overlap

- [?] How can we use atomic orbitals to explain bonding and to  
account for molecular geometries? 
- VSEPR does not explain why bonds exist.  
- The marriage of Lewis’s notion of electron-pair bonds and the idea of atomic orbitals leads to a model of chemical bonding, called _valence-bond theory_

Valence Bond theory (VB) approaches chemical bonding based on an extension of the quantum-mechanical model.  
- In valence-bond theory, electrons of two atoms occupy the same space.  
	- This is called “overlap” of orbitals.  
- The sharing of space between two electrons of opposite spin results in a covalent bond.  
- Bonding electron pairs are concentrated in the regions between atoms. and nonbonding electron pairs lie in directed regions of space away from the bonds

## Valence Bond Theory: Hybridization  
- [?] WHY Hybridization?

One of the issues that arises is that the number of partially filled or  
empty atomic orbitals does not predict the number of bonds or  
orientation of bonds.

To adjust for these inconsistencies, it was postulated that the  
valence atomic orbitals could hybridize before bonding took  
place.

# 9.5 Hybrid Orbitals  
- [?] How can we reconcile the notion that covalent bonds are formed from the overlap of atomic orbitals with the molecular geometries that come from the VSEPR model?

- To explain molecular geometries, we often assume that the  
atomic orbitals (_s, p, and d electron orbitals_) on an atom (_usually  
the central atom_) “**mix**” to form new orbitals called **hybrid  
orbitals**.  
- These **hybrid atomic orbitals** are used to form covalent bonds  with other atoms.  

- [1] Definition: Hybridizing is mixing different types of atomic orbitals  in the valence shell of an atom to make a new set of degenerate  orbitals (equivalent energy).  

- These hybrid orbitals had different shapes, energy levels, and  
orientations than the original orbitals from which they were  
formed.  
- Orbitals are not lost or gained. The number of hybrid orbitals on an atom equals to the number of atomic orbitals that are mixed.  
	- When two orbitals “mix” they create two orbitals; when three orbitals mix, they create three orbitals; and so on


## Hybridization

- [9] Types of Hybridization: $sp, sp^2, sp^3, sp^{3}d, sp^{3}d^{2}$  
-  The same type of atom can have different types of hybridization.
- Always start from an s orbital. Build your way up to p orbitals, and then d orbitals as necessary. These are orbitals from the atom in question
- Both _bonding_ and _lone pair_ of electrons from the hybridized  
atomic orbitals occupy the Hybrid orbitals.

## Types of Hybridization

- **sp hybridization**: mixing of _one s_ atomic orbital and _one p_ atomic orbital in the same energy level.  
• Gives **Linear** geometry arrangement of hybrid orbitals  
• Bond angle 180 degrees

## Hypervalent Molecules  

- These central atoms that have more than an octet.
Valence-bond model would use d orbitals to make more than  
four bonds.  
- This view works for period 3 through 6.  
- Application of hybridization to these molecules is not feasible at this point. A more detailed bonding view is needed than we will use in this course.
## Predicting Hybridization and Bonding Scheme

1) Draw the Lewis structure of the molecule or ion.  
2) Use VSEPR to determine the electron-domain geometry around the central atom.  
3) Specify the hybrid orbitals needed to accommodate these electron pairs (both bonding and non-bonding)based on their  geometric arrangement.
