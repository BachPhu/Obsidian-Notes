- Recognition of hybridization of the atoms in the given molecule

# 9.4 Covalent Bonding and Orbital Overlap

- [?] How can we use atomic orbitals to explain bonding and to  
account for molecular geometries? 
- VSEPR does not explain why bonds exist.  
- The marriage of Lewis’s notion of electron-pair bonds and the idea of atomic orbitals leads to a model of chemical bonding, called _valence-bond theory_

Valence Bond theory (VB) approaches chemical bonding based on an extension of the quantum-mechanical model.  
- In valence-bond theory, electrons of two atoms occupy the same space.  
	- This is called “overlap” of orbitals.  
- The sharing of space between two electrons of opposite spin results in a covalent bond.  
- Bonding electron pairs are concentrated in the regions between atoms. and nonbonding electron pairs lie in directed regions of space away from the bonds

## Valence Bond Theory: Hybridization  
- [?] WHY Hybridization?

One of the issues that arises is that the number of partially filled or  
empty atomic orbitals does not predict the number of bonds or  
orientation of bonds.

![[Pasted image 20231206123918.png|200]]


To adjust for these inconsistencies, it was postulated that the  
valence atomic orbitals could hybridize before bonding took  
place.

# 9.5 Hybrid Orbitals  
- [?] How can we reconcile the notion that covalent bonds are formed from the overlap of atomic orbitals with the molecular geometries that come from the VSEPR model?

- To explain molecular geometries, we often assume that the  
atomic orbitals (_s, p, and d electron orbitals_) on an atom (_usually  
the central atom_) “**mix**” to form new orbitals called **hybrid  
orbitals**.  
- These **hybrid atomic orbitals** are used to form covalent bonds  with other atoms.  

- [1] Definition: Hybridizing is mixing different types of atomic orbitals  in the valence shell of an atom to make a new set of degenerate  orbitals (equivalent energy).  

- These hybrid orbitals had different shapes, energy levels, and  
orientations than the original orbitals from which they were  
formed.  
- Orbitals are not lost or gained. The number of hybrid orbitals on an atom equals to the number of atomic orbitals that are mixed.  
	- When two orbitals “mix” they create two orbitals; when three orbitals mix, they create three orbitals; and so on


## Hybridization

- [9] Types of Hybridization: $sp, sp^2, sp^3, sp^{3}d, sp^{3}d^{2}$  
-  The same type of atom can have different types of hybridization.
- Always start from an s orbital. Build your way up to p orbitals, and then d orbitals as necessary. These are orbitals from the atom in question
- Both _bonding_ and _lone pair_ of electrons from the hybridized  
atomic orbitals occupy the Hybrid orbitals.

## Hypervalent Molecules

- These central atoms that have more than an octet.  
- Valence-bond model would use d orbitals to make more than four bonds.  
- This view works for period 3 through 6.  
- Application of hybridization to these molecules is not feasible at this point. A more detailed bonding view is needed than we will use in this course

## Geometry and Bond Angles and Hybridization in Covalent Molecules

When we know the electron-domain geometry, we can employ hybridization to describe bonding of atoms:  
1) Draw the Lewis structure of the molecule or ion.  
2) Use VSEPR to determine the electron-domain geometry around the central atom.  
3) Specify the hybrid orbitals needed to accommodate these electron pairs (both bonding and non-bonding)based on their geometric arrangement.

# 9.6 Multiple Bonds- Sigma and Pi Bonds  

- In a covalent bond, electron density is concentrated along the internuclear axis. This is  
designated a single bond.  
- To describe multiple covalent bonds, a second type of bond must be employed that  
results from the overlap between unhybridized p orbitals  
- Sigma bonds are characterized by  
	- head-to-head overlap.  
	- cylindrical symmetry of electron density _along the internuclear axis_ connecting the  two bonding nuclei.  $\sigma$ bond
	- Formed when Either standard atomic orbitals or hybrids overlap.  
		- s to s, p to p, hybrid to hybrid, s to hybrid, etc.  

- Pi bonds are characterized by  
	- sideways overlap.  
	- electron density above and below the internuclear axis: perpendicular to the internuclear axis.  $\pi$ bond
	- Between unhybridized parallel p orbitals


 ![[Screen Shot 2023-12-09 at 8.22.13 PM.png]]
- [n] sigma bonds are stronger than pi bonds

## Bonding in Molecules

single bond - 1 sigma
double- 1 sigma 1 pi
triple - 2 pi 1 sigma


## sp Hybridization & Multiple bonds

Each central atom has two sp hybrid orbitals and two unchanged p orbitals  
• sp orbitals form the $\sigma$ bond between the nitrogen atoms and hold lone pairs  
• The two Unhybridized p orbitals form the two $\pi$ bonds

## Predicting Hybridization of an atom


- Draw a proper Lewis structure  
- **If only Bonding Groups**: The number of bonds (bonding electron  clouds needed) of the central atom equals the number of orbitals that need to be hybridized.  
- **If both Bonding and non-bonding pairs exist**: Please consider  that lone pairs as well. If there is a lone pair when you complete  the Lewis structure, then _the number of required hybrid orbitals  equals the number of lone pairs plus the number of bonds_.  
- Label the bonds as $\sigma$ or $pi$
