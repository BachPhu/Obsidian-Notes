# <font color = #8E7CC3> 5.1 Writing Summaries </font>

A **summary** is a comprehensive and objective restatement of the main ideas of a text

Some good qualities to a good summary:
- _Neutrality_ : 
	- avoids inserting his or her opinion into the summary, or interpreting the original text’s content in any way
	- avoids language that is evaluative, such as: good, bad, effective, ineffective, interesting, boring, etc
	- Keep “I” out of the summary; instead, summary should be written in grammatical 3rd person
- _Brevity_ – The summary should not be longer than the original text, but rather highlight the most important information, leave out unnecessary details while still maintain accuracy.
- _Independence_ – The summary should make sense to someone who has not read the original source. There should be no confusion about the main content and organization of the original source.

> You’re summarizing well when you
> - use your own words
> - significantly condense the original text
> - provide accurate representations of the main points of the text they summarize
> - avoid personal opinion.

Summaries are much shorter than the original material—a general rule is that they should be no more than _10% to 15%_ the length of the original

> If we only focus on ideas that support our point, it can create two problems:
> - It no longer accurate to the og text, mislead your reader
> - Since the info is not accurate, readers most likely won't trust you and might not trust your point through out the essay

## **How Should I Organize a Summary?**

###  _Introducing a Summary_
Make sure that the readers know that this is not your ideas but someone else's. 

> [!NOTE]
> Introduction should accomplish a few things:
> 
> - Introduce the name of the author whose work you are summarizing.
> - Introduce the title of the text being summarized.
> - Introduce where this text was presented (if it’s an art installation, where is it being shown? If it’s an article, where was that article published? Not all texts will have this component–for example, when summarizing a book written by one author, the title of the book and name of that author are sufficient information for your readers to easily locate the work you are summarizing).
> - State the main ideas of the text you are summarizing—just the big-picture components.
> - Give context when necessary. Is this text responding to a current event? That might be important to know. Does this author have specific qualifications that make them an expert on this topic? This might also be relevant information.

This information will appear again in your bibliography, but is also useful here so the reader can follow the conversation happening in your paper. You will want to provide it in both places.

### _The “Meat” (or Body) of a Summary_
- You will introduce the main ideas throughout your text with transitional phrasing, such as “One of [Author’s] biggest points is…,” or “[Author’s] primary concern about this solution is….”

 - Key points the author makes about each of those big-picture main ideas? 
 
 - May want to note how the main ideas are supported (avoid making your own opinion about those supporting sources known).
 
 - Make sure you understand the larger points of the original text ([[Example for Caution w Opposing View]])

### _Concluding a Summary_

 Ideas for your conclusion:
 - Are there any connections or loose ends to tie up that will help your reader fully understand the points being made in this text? This is the place to put those.
 - State (or restate) the things that are most important for your readers to remember after reading your summary.
 - Depending on your assignment,  you may want to simply paraphrase the author’s concluding section or final main idea.
 
When your writing has a primary goal other than summary, your conclusion should:
- discuss the summary you’ve just presented. How does it support, illustrate, or give new information about the point you are making in your writing? Connect it to your own main point for that paragraph so readers understand clearly why it deserves the space it takes up in your work. (Note that this is still not giving your opinion on the material you’ve summarized, just making connections between it and your own main points.)


#  <font color = #8E7CC3> 5.2 Synthesizing in Your Writing</font>

## **How do you synthesize?**

Below are some steps you can use to help you synthesize research:

1. Determine the goal(s) for your discussion such as reviewing a topic or supporting an argument
2. Organize the discussion among the authors of your found researched materials
3. Lead the discussion among the authors of your sources
4. Provide comments and build logical guidance for your audience
5. Summarize the most vivid of the authors’ examples and explanations
6. Finally, draw your unique conclusion on the topic: in fact, the answer to your research question

## **What synthesis is NOT**

- Synthesizing does not mean summarizing everyone’s opinion
- Synthesizing does not mean critiquing opinions
- Synthesizing does not simply comparative texts. You are neither evaluating nor comparing the effectiveness of the authors’ presentations.

## **What synthesis IS**

When you synthesize, you “cook” the ideas and opinions of others by thinking, talking, and writing about them, and what comes out is a dish full of many blended flavors but uniquely your recipe : [[Example of What Synthesis Could Be]]

# <font color = #8E7CC3 >5.3 Make Connections When Synthesizing in Your Writing  </font>

 - When you synthesize, you are responding to the voices and ideas of others, so you should be as flexible in your written response to them as you would be in a verbal response to those you were having a discussion with about a complex topic. 
 
 - Primarily, your synthesis will indicate agreement or disagreement with your sources, but it may also recognize patterns of thinking, errors in logic, or the omission of important points—whatever it is you are adding to the conversation.

### [[Synthesis that adds to the conversation in other ways]]

### [[ Other Examples of Sentence Structures that Demonstrate Synthesis ]]

What the above examples indicate is that synthesis is the careful weaving in of outside opinions in order to show your reader the many ideas and arguments on your topic and further assert your own. Notice, too, that the above examples are also _signal phrases_: language that introduces outside source material to be either quoted or paraphrased


# <font color = #8E7CC3> 5.4 Informative vs. Argumentative Synthesis </font>

## **What is an Informative/Explanatory Synthesisis?**

In informative writing, you are explaining the discussion points and topics to your readers without taking a position of one side or another, without showing your opinion. 

> [!NOTE]
> - You have to objectively introduce the ideas of others, explain and show how their information is related to each other’s, how the information may connect and diverge. 
> - Stay neutral both in your comments on the found information and in your conclusions reached at the end of the discussion.
