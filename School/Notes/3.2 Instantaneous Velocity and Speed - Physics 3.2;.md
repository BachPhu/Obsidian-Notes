# Instantaneous Velocity
 
It is the average velocity between two points on the path in the limit that the time (and therefore the displacement) between the two events approaches zero.  The expression for the average velocity between two points using this notation is:
$$\overline v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac {x_{t_2} - x_{t_1}}{t_{2}-t_{1}}$$

To find the instantaneous velocity at any position, we let $\color{#84C1FF}t_{1} = t$ and $\color{#8E7CC3}t_{2}= \color{#84C1FF}t \color{#8E7CC3}+ \Delta t$

We find: 

$$v(t) = \lim_{\Delta t â†’ 0} \frac{x\color{#8E7CC3}(t + \Delta t) \color{white}- x(t)}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx(t)}{dt}
$$
which equals

$$v(t)=\frac{d}{dt}x(t)$$

# Instantaneous Speed

$$s(t) = \vert v(t) \vert$$
