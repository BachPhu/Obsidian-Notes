# 10.4 Gas Mixtures and Partial Pressures ‚Äì Dalton‚Äôs Law


‚Ä¢ If two gases that don‚Äôt react are combined in a container, they act as if they are alone in the container.  
‚Ä¢ Dalton‚Äôs Law of Partial Pressures: the total pressure $ùëÉ_{total}$ of a mixture of gases equals the sum of the pressures that each gas $P_{i}$ would exert if it were present alone

Expression for Dalton‚Äôs law of partial pressures

$$ P_{total} = P_1 + P_2+ P_{3}+ ...$$

- Therefore, Total pressure exerted by a mixture of gases is the sum of the pressures of the individual gases  
‚Ä¢ Identities of the gas particles do not matter

If $P_{t} = n_{1}\frac{RT}{V} + n_{2}\frac{RT}{V} + n_{3}\frac{RT}{V}$ then $$P_{t}=n_{t}\frac{RT}{V}$$
## Mole Fractions and Partial Pressure  
‚Ä¢ The ratio of the number of moles of a particular component i in the mixture to the total number of moles in the mixture.  
‚Ä¢ Define mole fraction, $\chi$ 

$$\chi_{1} = \frac{\text{moles of compound 1}}{\text{total moles}} = \frac{n_1}{n_{t}}$$
$\chi_{1} = \frac{n_i}{n_{total}}$

The partial pressure that a gas in a mixture exerts is proportional to its mole fraction:
$$$$
$$P_i = \chi_{i}P_{total}$$


## Collecting Gaseous Products

Water displacement can be used to  collect and measure the volume of  any gas that does not dissolve in  water:  
 $$P_{total} = P_{atm} = P_{O_2} + P_{H_{2}O}$$

# 10.5 Kinetic-Molecular Theory of Gases

The behavior of gases can be described using kinetic molecular theory (KMT), which is based upon four assumptions:  
1) Gases consist of large numbers of molecules that are in continuous, random motion.  
2) The combined volume of all the molecules of the gas is negligible relative to the total volume in which the gas is contained.  
3) Attractive and repulsive forces between gas molecules are negligible.  
4) Energy can be transferred between molecules during collisions, but the average kinetic energy of the molecules does not change with time, as long as the temperature of the gas remains constant.  
5) The average kinetic energy of the molecules is proportional to the absolute temperature.

## Gas Laws Explained‚ÄîBoyle‚Äôs Law

Boyle‚Äôs law states that the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure.  
- Decreasing the volume forces the molecules into a smaller space.  
-  An increase in volume at constant temperature causes the pressure to decrease.  

Explanation to Boyle‚Äôs Law  
‚Äì Average kinetic energy is unchanged.  
‚Äì Increase in volume: Molecules move a longer distance between collisions.  
‚Äì Fewer wall collisions per unit time

## Gas Laws Explained‚ÄîCharles‚Äôs Law
Charles‚Äôs law states that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the absolute temperature.  
- According to kinetic molecular theory, when we increase the temperature of a gas, the average speed, and thus the average kinetic energy, of the particles increases.  

Explanation to Charles‚Äôs Law  
‚Äì Increase in temperature: Increase in average kinetic energy.  
‚Äì More collisions with walls per unit time.  
‚Äì Momentum causes more forceful collisions.-more pressure  

- To keep the pressure constant, volume must increase

## Gas Laws Explained‚ÄîAvogadro‚Äôs Law

Avogadro‚Äôs law states that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of gas molecules.  
-  Increasing the number of gas molecules causes more of them to hit the wall at the same time.

Explanation to Avogadro‚Äôs Law  
‚Äì Average kinetic energy is unchanged.  
‚Äì Increase in number of gas molecules: More collisions per unit time.  
‚Äì Causes more pressure.  
-  To keep the pressure constant, volume must increase.

# 10.6 Molecular Speeds, Effusion, and Diffusion

- At any given temperature, the average kinetic energy of molecules is the same.
- So, $KE_{avg} = \frac{3}{2}k_{B}T$ is the same for two gases at the same temperature
- If a gas has a low mass, its speed will be greater than for a heavier molecule.

$$KE_{avg} = \frac{3}{2}k_{B}T$$
$$u_{rms}= \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{M}} $$

## Effusion

Effusion: is the escape of gas molecules through a tiny hole into an evacuated space.  
‚Ä¢ Tiny imperfections in the balloon allow gas particles to slowly escape in a process called effusion.

- Graham‚Äôs law of effusion
Effusion rate $$\propto \sqrt{\frac{1}{density}} \propto \sqrt{\frac{1}{molar mass}}$$

## Diffusion  
‚Ä¢ Diffusion - Diffusion of gases is defined as the spread of one substance through another or throughout a space.  
‚Ä¢ Mean free path - The average distance that a particle can travel through air or any gas before colliding with another one is called the mean free path of the particle

## Mathematical Representation of Graham‚Äôs Law Describes Diffusion and Effusion

  
If particles of gas A have higher speeds than particles of gas B, then gas A particles collide more frequently with the walls of the container, and this increases effusion.

$$\frac{\text{effusion rate}_{A}  }{\text{effusion rate}_{B}} = \sqrt{\frac{M_{B}}{M_{A}}}$$
$M_{A}$ and $M_{B}$ - Molar masses of the gases

# 10.7 Real Gases 

- In the real world, the behavior of gases conforms to the ideal-gas equation only at relatively high temperature and low pressure.  
- Even the same gas will show wildly different  behavior under high pressure at different temperatures.

## Deviations from Ideality

- At lower temperatures and higher pressures the attractive forces between particles are significant and must be taken into account.  
- Gases are not infinitely compressible and at high pressures the actual volume occupied by the gas molecules is important

The assumptions made in the kinetic-molecular model (negligible volume of gas  
molecules themselves, no attractive forces between gas molecules, etc.) break down  
at high pressure and/or low temperature

## Corrections for Nonideal Behavior
  
- One equation corrected for real gases is known as the _van der Waals equation_.  
- The pressure adjustment is due to the fact that molecules attract and repel each other.  
- The volume adjustment is due to the fact that molecules occupy some space on their own.
