# Chemical Bonds

There are three basic types of bonds  
-  Ionic  
	- Electrostatic attraction between ions  
- Covalent  
	- Sharing of electrons  
- Metallic  
	- Free electrons hold metal atoms together

# 8.1 Lewis Symbols and the Octet Rule

- The electrons involved in chemical bonding are the _valence electrons_, which, for most atoms, are those in the _outermost occupied shell_

- Atoms tend to lose, gain, or share electrons until they are surrounded by eight valence electrons. The Octet Rule

# 8.2 Ionic Bonding

## Transfer of electrons

- Predict the charge of common metallic and nonmetallic elements  
- Explain the formation of cations, anions, and ionic compounds  

**Ionic bonds**: electrostatic forces of attraction between oppositely charged cations and anions. 
	- Between metals and nonmetals (except group 8A)  
	- Involve electron transfer  
	- Very exothermic  

-  The energy released when one mole of an ionic compound forms from its free ions in  
the gas phase.

## Lewis Structures

A Lewis structure is a two-dimensional representation of a compound showing how its atoms are connected.  
- One element readily gives up an electron (has a low ionization energy).  
- Another element readily gains an electron (has a high electron affinity).  
- Cations of groups 1 and 2 have no valence-shell electrons so Lewis symbol has no dots.  
- Anions gained electrons to fill the valance-shell so Lewis symbol has four pairs of  
electrons

# Properties of Ionic Substances

There is evidence of a well-defined three-dimensional structure:  
‚Ä¢ Brittle  
‚Ä¢ High melting points  
‚Ä¢ Crystalline  
‚Ä¢ Cleave along smooth lines

## Lattice Energy

- Ionic solids consist of a crystal lattice. A crystal lattice is an ordered three-dimensional array of particles.  
- **Lattice Energy** - The energy released when one mole of an ionic compound forms from its free ions in the gas phase.  
- It is the energy required to completely separate one mole of a solid ionic compound into its gaseous ions.  
- This is a measure of how much stability results in arranging oppositely charged  ions in an ionic solid.
- Electrostatic potential energy:


$$ùê∏_{el} = 2.31 √ó 10‚àí19\text{ } J \cdot nm \text{ }(\frac{Q_{1} \times Q_{2}}{d})$$

# 8.3 Covalent Bonding

## Sharing

- Describe the formation of covalent bonds  
- Define electronegativity and assess the polarity of covalent bonds  

- A covalent bond is formed when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons. Primarily nonmetals. 

- interactions in these bonds:  
	- Attractions between electrons and nuclei  
	- Repulsions between electrons  
	- Repulsions between nuclei  

‚Ä¢ For a bond to form, the attractions must be greater than the repulsions

## Lewis Structures

- Sharing electrons to make covalent bonds can be demonstrated using Lewis structures.  
- We start by trying to give each atom the same number of electrons as the nearest noble gas by sharing electrons.  
-  The simplest examples are for hydrogen, H2, and chlorine, Cl2, shown below.

### Number of Bonds for Nonmetals

- The group number is the number of valence electrons.  
- To get an octet (nearest noble gas configuration) in the simplest covalent molecules for nonmetals, the number of bonds needed will be the same as the electrons needed to complete the octet.
