# Chemical Bonds

There are three basic types of bonds  
-  Ionic  
	- Electrostatic attraction between ions  
- Covalent  
	- Sharing of electrons  
- Metallic  
	- Free electrons hold metal atoms together

- Atoms tend to lose, gain, or share electrons until they are surrounded by eight valence electrons. The Octet Rule
