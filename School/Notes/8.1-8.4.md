# Chemical Bonds

There are three basic types of bonds  
-  Ionic  
	- Electrostatic attraction between ions  
- Covalent  
	- Sharing of electrons  
- Metallic  
	- Free electrons hold metal atoms together

# 8.1 Lewis Symbols and the Octet Rule

- The electrons involved in chemical bonding are the _valence electrons_, which, for most atoms, are those in the _outermost occupied shell_

- Atoms tend to lose, gain, or share electrons until they are surrounded by eight valence electrons. The Octet Rule

# 8.2 Ionic Bonding

## Transfer of electrons

- Predict the charge of common metallic and nonmetallic elements  
- Explain the formation of cations, anions, and ionic compounds  

**Ionic bonds**: electrostatic forces of attraction between oppositely charged cations and anions. 
	- Between metals and nonmetals (except group 8A)  
	- Involve electron transfer  
	- Very exothermic  

-  The energy released when one mole of an ionic compound forms from its free ions in  
the gas phase.

## Lewis Structures

A Lewis structure is a two-dimensional representation of a compound showing how its atoms are connected.  
• One element readily gives up an electron (has a low ionization energy).  
• Another element readily gains an electron (has a high electron affinity).  
• Cations of groups 1 and 2 have no valence-shell electrons so Lewis symbol has no dots.  
• Anions gained electrons to fill the valance-shell so Lewis symbol has four pairs of  
electrons
