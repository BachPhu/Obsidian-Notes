# Key Equations

This is the formula to calculate the mass percentage of each element in a compound. The sum of the percentages of all elements in a compound should add up to 100%.

$$\text{\% mass composition of element =  }\frac{\text{(\# of atoms) (atomic weight)} }{\text{formula weight of compound}} \times 100\%$$
This is the formula to calculate the percent yield of a reaction. The percent yield can never be more than 100%
$$\text{percent yield = } \frac{\text{actual yield}}{\text{theoretical yield}} \times 100 $$

# Concept
## Chemical Equations

The study of the quantitative relationships between chemical formulas and chemical equations is known as **stoichiometry**. One of the important concepts of stoichiometry is the **law of conservation of mass**, which states that the total mass of the products of a chemical reaction is the same as the total mass of the reactants. The same numbers of atoms of each type are present before and after a chemical reaction. A balanced **chemical equation** shows equal numbers of atoms of each element on each side of the equation. Equations are balanced by placing coefficients in front of the chemical formulas for the **reactants** and **products** of a reaction, not by changing the subscripts in chemical formulas.

## Simple Patterns of Chemical Reactivity

Among the reaction types described in this chapter are (1) **combination reactions**, in which two reactants combine to form one product; (2) **decomposition reactions**, in which a single reactant forms two or more products; and (3) **combustion reactions** in oxygen, in which a substance, typically a hydrocarbon, reacts rapidly with O2 to form CO2 and H2O.

## Formula Weights

Much quantitative information can be determined from chemical formulas and balanced chemical equations by using atomic weights. The **formula weight** of a compound equals the sum of the atomic weights of the atoms in its formula. If the formula is a molecular formula, the formula weight is also called the **molecular weight**. Atomic weights and formula weights can be used to determine the **elemental composition** of a compound.

## Avogadro’s Number and the Mole

A mole of any substance contains **Avogadro's number** (6.02×1023) of formula units of that substance. The mass of a **mole** of atoms, molecules, or ions (the **molar mass**) equals the formula weight of that material expressed in grams. The mass of 1 molecule of H2O, for example, is 18.0 amu, so the mass of 1 mol of H2O is 18.0 g. That is, the molar mass of H2O is 18.0 g/mol.

## Empirical Formulas from Analysis

The empirical formula of any substance can be determined from its percent composition by calculating the relative number of moles of each atom in an arbitrary-sized sample (typically 100 g) of the substance. If the substance is molecular in nature, its molecular formula can be determined from the empirical formula if the molecular weight is also known. Combustion analysis is a special technique for determining the empirical formulas of compounds containing only carbon, hydrogen, and/or oxygen.

## Quantitative Information from Balanced Equations and Limiting Reactants

The mole concept can be used to calculate the relative quantities of reactants and products in chemical reactions. The coefficients in a balanced equation give the relative numbers of moles of the reactants and products. To calculate the number of grams of a product from the number of grams of a reactant, first convert grams of reactant to moles of reactant. Then use the coefficients in the balanced equation to convert the number of moles of reactant to moles of product. Finally, convert moles of product to grams of product.

A **limiting reactant** is the reactant that is completely consumed in a reaction. When it is used up, the reaction stops, thus limiting the quantities of products formed. The **theoretical yield** of a reaction is the quantity of product calculated to form when the limiting reactant is fully consumed. The actual yield of a reaction is the amount of product experimentally obtained in a reaction; it is always less than the theoretical yield. The **percent yield** is the actual yield divided by the theoretical yield, converted to a percentage.
