# Amount Of Change Formula

- Amount of change $$\Delta y = f(a + h) - f(a)$$
- Average rate of change $$\frac{ f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}$$
- Instantaneous rate of change $$f'(a) = \lim_{h â†’ 0} \frac{ f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}

$$
For small enough value (close to 0), we can solve for $f(a + h)$ by:
$$f(a +h ) = f(a) + f'(a)h$$

# Cost, Revenue, Profit

- Marginal cost $MC(x)$ is 
	$$MC(x) = C'(x)$$
- Marginal revenue $MR(x)$ is $$MR(x)= R'(x)$$
- Marginal profit $MP(x)$ is $$MP(x) = R'(x) - C'(x)$$
