# 3.6 Quantitative Information from Balanced Equations: Chemical Stoichiometry

- Use balanced chemical equations to derive stoichiometric factors relating amounts of reactants and products  
• Perform stoichiometric calculations involving mass, moles, and solution molarity

The coefficients in the balanced equation show  
▪ Relative numbers of molecules of reactants and products  
▪ Relative numbers of moles of reactants and products, which can be converted to mass  
	• to determine the amount of one reactant required to react with a given amount of another reactant  
	• to calculate the yield (amount) of product, etc

> [!NOTE]
> - The new calculation is how to compare two different materials, using the mole ratio from the balanced equation. This referred to as using stoichiometry.  
>- The mole ratio comes from the coefficients in the balanced equation.


# 3.7 Limiting Reactants

**When you finish Section 3.5, you should be able to:**



- The **limiting reactant** is the reactant present in the _smallest stoichiometric_ amount  (which is completely consumed during the reaction).  
	- In other words, it is the reactant you _will run out of first_  
	- Determines the amount of product formed (Theoretical Yield) in a chemical reaction from the given mixture of reactants.  
• **Excess reactant**: reactant which is not completely consumed

## Stoichiometric Mixture

Stoichiometric Mixture: A type of mixture that contains relative amounts of reactants  
that match the numbers in the balanced equation
- All reactants run out at the same time

## Theoretical Yield and Actual Yield

Theoretical Yield: This is the maximum amount of product that could be obtained  
from the given quantities of the reactants.  
	• The theoretical yield is the maximum amount of product calculated  
	through the stoichiometry problem.  
	• Theoretical yield is sometimes called stoichiometric yield or 100% yield.  

Actual yield: The actual yield, which is the amount one produced and measured  
(by experiment)
