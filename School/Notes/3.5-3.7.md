# 3.6 Quantitative Information from Balanced Equations: Chemical Stoichiometry

- Use balanced chemical equations to derive stoichiometric factors relating amounts of reactants and products  
• Perform stoichiometric calculations involving mass, moles, and solution molarity

The coefficients in the balanced equation show  
▪ Relative numbers of molecules of reactants and products  
▪ Relative numbers of moles of reactants and products, which can be converted to mass  
	• to determine the amount of one reactant required to react with a given amount of another reactant  
	• to calculate the yield (amount) of product, etc

> [!NOTE]
> - The new calculation is how to compare two different materials, using the mole  
> ratio from the balanced equation. This referred to as using stoichiometry.  
>- The mole ratio comes from the coefficients in the balanced equation.


# 3.7 Limiting Reactants

- The limiting reactant is the reactant present in the smallest stoichiometric amount  
(which is completely consumed during the reaction).  
	- In other words, it is the reactant you will run out of first  
	- Determines the amount of product formed (Theoretical Yield) in a chemical  
	reaction from the given mixture of reactants.  
• Excess reactant: reactant which is not completely consumed

## Stoichiometric Mixture

Stoichiometric Mixture: A type of mixture that contains relative amounts of reactants  
that match the numbers in the balanced equation
- All reactants run out at the same time
