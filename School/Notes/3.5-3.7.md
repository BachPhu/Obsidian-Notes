# 3.6 Quantitative Information from Balanced Equations: Chemical Stoichiometry

- Use balanced chemical equations to derive stoichiometric factors relating amounts of reactants and products  
• Perform stoichiometric calculations involving mass, moles, and solution molarity

The coefficients in the balanced equation show  
▪ Relative numbers of molecules of reactants and products  
▪ Relative numbers of moles of reactants and products, which can be converted to mass  
	• to determine the amount of one reactant required to react with a given amount of another reactant  
	• to calculate the yield (amount) of product, etc

> [!NOTE]
> - The new calculation is how to compare two different materials, using the mole ratio from the balanced equation. This referred to as using stoichiometry.  
>- The mole ratio comes from the coefficients in the balanced equation.


# 3.7 Limiting Reactants

> - 3.7.1 Determine the limiting reactant for a reaction from the quantities (grams, moles, or molecules) of each reactant present before the reaction starts.
>     
> - 3.7.2 Calculate the theoretical yield for a reaction from the quantities (grams, moles, or molecules) of the limiting reactant present before the reaction starts.

- The **limiting reactant** is the reactant present in the _smallest stoichiometric_ amount  (which is completely consumed during the reaction).  
	- In other words, it is the reactant you _will run out of first_  
	- Determines the amount of product formed (Theoretical Yield) in a chemical reaction from the given mixture of reactants.  
• **Excess reactant**: reactant which is not completely consumed

## Stoichiometric Mixture

Stoichiometric Mixture: A type of mixture that contains relative amounts of reactants  
that match the numbers in the balanced equation
- All reactants run out at the same time

## Theoretical Yield and Actual Yield

Theoretical Yield: This is the maximum amount of product that could be obtained  
from the given quantities of the reactants.  
	• The theoretical yield is the maximum amount of product calculated  
	through the stoichiometry problem.  
	• Theoretical yield is sometimes called stoichiometric yield or 100% yield.  

Actual yield: The actual yield, which is the amount one produced and measured  
(by experiment)

### Percent Yield
The amount of product produced in a reaction, the actual yield, is  
often less than the theoretical yield

$$\text{percent yield = } \frac{\text{actual yield}}{\text{theoretical yield}} \times 100 $$
# 3.5 Empirical Formulas from Analyses

> [!Objective]
> - 3.5.1 Calculate the empirical formula of a compound from the mass percentages of the elements that make up the compound.
>     
> - 3.5.2 Determine the molecular formula of a molecular compound given its empirical formula and molecular weight.
>     
> - 3.5.3 Determine the empirical formula of a compound containing only carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen from the results of combustion analysis.

# Empirical Formula  
Empirical formula of a compound is defined as the formula which gives the  
simplest whole number ratios of atoms of the various elements present in  
the molecule

EX: 
- Glucose C6 H12 O 6  
- Empirical Formula is CH2O  
- It means C,H, & O are present in the simplest ratio of 1:2:1

# Molecular Formula  
Defined as the formula which gives the actual number of atoms of various element  
present in the molecule of the compound

- As, the number of atoms in a molecular formula is a multiple of the number of  
atoms in an empirical formula.  
• If we find the empirical formula and know a molar mass (molecular weight) for  
the compound, we can find the molecular formula

$$\text{Whole number multiple = } \frac{\text{Molecular weight}}{\text{Empirical formula weight}}$$
$$\text{Molecular weight = Empirical formula } \times \text{\color{#FF6666}n} $$
# Steps for Deriving Empirical Formula

![[Pasted image 20230928223720.png]]

1. Each percent will represent the mass in grams of that element  
2. Derive the number of moles of each element: Divide the % or mass of each element by its atomic mass .  
3. Divide the quantitates of each element by the lowest value to yield mole ratio (subscripts for a tentative  
empirical formula)  
	• manage to obtain a whole number ratio of subscripts is obtained.  
4. Finally write every whole number with reference to atom.  
5. To derive the molecular formula: find the ‘n’ value and multiply the empirical formula with ‘n’
