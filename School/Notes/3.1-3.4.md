# 3.1 Chemical Equations

> [!Objective]
> **When you finish Section 3.1, you should be able to:**
> 
> - 3.1.1 Explain the law of conservation of mass in terms of the reactants and products of a chemical equation.
> - 3.1.2 Balance chemical equations by writing out the chemical formulas (and appropriate coefficients) of the reactants and products.

**Stoichiometry** (pronounced stoy-key-OM-uh-tree, roughly meaning “element measure” in Greek) is the area of study that examines the quantities of substances consumed and produced in chemical reactions

## Chemical Equations
We represent chemical reactions by **chemical equations**. When the gas hydrogen (H2) burns, for example, it reacts with oxygen (O2) in the air to form water (H2O). We write the chemical equation for this reaction as

$$2H_{2}+ O_{2} → 2H_{2}O$$

We read the + sign as “reacts with” and the arrow as “produces.” The chemical formulas to the _left_ of the arrow represent the starting substances, called **reactants**. The chemical formulas to the _right_ of the arrow represent substances produced in the reaction, called **products**. The numbers in front of the formulas, called coefficients, indicate the relative numbers of molecules of each kind involved in the reaction.

## Balancing Equations
### Writing Balanced Chemical Equations  
• According to the law of conservation of mass, all chemical equations must be  
balanced.  
• The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on the left-  
and right-hand side of the reaction arrow.  
• The masses of the products must equal the masses of the reactants

$$S(s) + O_2(g) → SO_2(g)  $$
Mass Ratio$$ 32.06 g + 32.00 g → 64.06 g$$

### Significance of a balanced chemical equation  
Qualitative: names of reactants and products  
Quantitative:  
1. Relative number of molecules of the reactants and product  
2. Relative number of moles  
3. Relative masses  
4. Relative volumes

## Steps to Balance Chemical Equations  
1. Write a preliminary expression containing a single particle (atom, molecule, or  
formula unit) of each reactant and product with a reaction arrow separating  
reactants from products. Include phase symbols indicating physical states.  
2. Check whether the expression is balanced by counting the atoms of each  
element on each side of the reaction arrow.  
3. Choose an element that appears in only one reactant and one product and  
balance it first.  
4. Choose coefficients for the other substances so that the number of atoms for  
each element is the same on both sides of the reaction arrow.  
5. Balance polyatomic ions (if present on both sides of the chemical equation) as a  
unit.

# 3.2 Simple Patterns of Chemical Reactivity

> [!Objective]
> **When you finish Section 3.2, you should be able to:**
> 
> - 3.2.1 Identify combination reactions and predict their reaction products.
>     
> - 3.2.2 Identify decomposition reactions and predict their reaction products.
>     
> - 3.2.3 Identify combustion reactions and predict their reaction products.

There are many different types of chemical reactions.  
	Three broad classes of reactions can be predicted:  
	▪ Combination reactions  
	▪ Decomposition reactions  
	▪ Combustion reactions

## Combination Reactions
Two or more substances react to form one product
Hint: Use common charges for Groups)

##  Decomposition reactions 
One substance breaks down into two or more substances

## Combustion reactions
Combustion means burning, usually in oxygen(in the air) producing  
heat, and usually light and fire

# 3.3 Atomic Mass-Calculating Average Atomic Mass

The arbitrary standard that has been established for describing atomic mass is the atomic mass unit (amu or u), defined as one-twelfth of the mass of one atom of $^{12}C$ 

Carbon-12 = 12.00 amu (mass of 1 atom of carbon in atomic mass units)  
(1/12) of the mass of a carbon atom, 1 amu = $1.6605 *  10^{-24}$ g  
conversely: 1 gram =$6.02214 *  10^{23}$ amu

## Formula Weight  
The formula weight is used for ionic compounds.  
• The formula unit is used since there are no molecules present.  

For calcium chloride ($CaCl_{2}$):

## Percentage composition

$$\text{ \% (mass) of an elememt =  } \frac{\text {(No. of atoms) * (atomic mass)} }{\text {molar mass of the compound}} * 100$$


# 3.4 Mole Concept and Avogadro’s Number

- The chemical changes we observe always involve discrete numbers of atoms that  
rearrange themselves into new configurations. These numbers are HUGE.  
• In a lab, we cannot work with individual molecules. They are too small.  
• The mole concept provides this bridge and is central to all quantitative chemistry

## The Mole

> [!Important]
> • The mole (abbreviated: mol) is the SI unit for expressing quantities  
> (chemical entity) of substances.  
> • 1 mole = 6.022 × $10^{23}$ particles or atoms (Avogadro’s constant, NA)

Number of particles of the substance is related to the mass of the  
substance.  
Example: 22.99 g of Na / 6.022 × 1023 Na atoms  
1 mole of Na

## Molar Mass

- A molar mass is the mass of 1 mol of a substance (i.e.,  gram/mole) (atom, molecule, or formula unit).  
- The formula weight (in amu) will be the same number as the  molar mass (in gram/mol).  
- One mole of atoms, ions, or molecules contains Avogadro’s  number of those particles![[Screen Shot 2023-09-22 at 12.20.08 AM.png]]![[Screen Shot 2023-09-22 at 12.20.32 AM.png]]

## Conversions Using Avogadro’s Constant

Avogadro’s constant can be used to convert between number of  particles and the number of moles of a substance (or vice versa).  
(particles refer to atoms, elements, ions, electrons, etc.)

# 3.6 Quantitative Information from Balanced Equations:Chemical Stoichiometry

- Use balanced chemical equations to derive stoichiometric factors relating amounts of reactants and products  
• Perform stoichiometric calculations involving mass, moles, and solution molarity

The coefficients in the balanced equation show  
▪ Relative numbers of molecules of reactants and products  
▪ Relative numbers of moles of reactants and products, which can be converted to mass  
	• to determine the amount of one reactant required to react with a given amount of another reactant  
	• to calculate the yield (amount) of product, etc

## Stoichiometric Calculations

> [!NOTE]
> - The new calculation is how to compare two different materials, using the mole  
> ratio from the balanced equation. This referred to as using stoichiometry.  
>- The mole ratio comes from the coefficients in the balanced equation.


# 3.7 Limiting Reactants

- The limiting reactant is the reactant present in the smallest stoichiometric amount  
(which is completely consumed during the reaction).  
	- In other words, it is the reactant you will run out of first  
	- Determines the amount of product formed (Theoretical Yield) in a chemical  
	reaction from the given mixture of reactants.  
• Excess reactant: reactant which is not completely consumed
