**Stoichiometry** (pronounced stoy-key-OM-uh-tree, roughly meaning “element measure” in Greek) is the area of study that examines the quantities of substances consumed and produced in chemical reactions

## Chemical Equations
We represent chemical reactions by **chemical equations**. When the gas hydrogen (H2) burns, for example, it reacts with oxygen (O2) in the air to form water (H2O). We write the chemical equation for this reaction as

$$2H_{2}+ O_{2} → 2H_{2}O$$

We read the + sign as “reacts with” and the arrow as “produces.” The chemical formulas to the _left_ of the arrow represent the starting substances, called **reactants**. The chemical formulas to the _right_ of the arrow represent substances produced in the reaction, called **products**. The numbers in front of the formulas, called coefficients, indicate the relative numbers of molecules of each kind involved in the reaction.

## Balancing Equations
### Writing Balanced Chemical Equations  
• According to the law of conservation of mass, all chemical equations must be  
balanced.  
• The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on the left-  
and right-hand side of the reaction arrow.  
• The masses of the products must equal the masses of the reactants

$$S(s) + O_2(g) → SO_2(g)  $$
Mass Ratio$$ 32.06 g + 32.00 g → 64.06 g$$

### Significance of a balanced chemical equation  
Qualitative: names of reactants and products  
Quantitative:  
1. Relative number of molecules of the reactants and product  
2. Relative number of moles  
3. Relative masses  
4. Relative volumes

## Steps to Balance Chemical Equations  
1. Write a preliminary expression containing a single particle (atom, molecule, or  
formula unit) of each reactant and product with a reaction arrow separating  
reactants from products. Include phase symbols indicating physical states.  
2. Check whether the expression is balanced by counting the atoms of each  
element on each side of the reaction arrow.  
3. Choose an element that appears in only one reactant and one product and  
balance it first.  
4. Choose coefficients for the other substances so that the number of atoms for  
each element is the same on both sides of the reaction arrow.  
5. Balance polyatomic ions (if present on both sides of the chemical equation) as a  
unit.

# 3.2 Simple Patterns of Chemical Reactivity

> - 3.2.1 Identify combination reactions and predict their reaction products.

There are many different types of chemical reactions.  
	Three broad classes of reactions can be predicted:  
	▪ Combination reactions  
	▪ Decomposition reactions  
	▪ Combustion reactions

## Combination Reactions
Two or more substances react to form one product
Hint: Use common charges for Groups)

| Combination Reactions |     |
| --------------------- | --- |
| $A+B → C$             |   Two or more reactants combine to form a  single product. Many elements react with one  another in this fashion to form compounds  |
|      $N_{2}(g ) + 3 H_{2}(g ) → 2 NH_{3}(g )$  ||

##  Decomposition reactions 
One substance breaks down into two or more substances
## Combustion reactions
Combustion means burning, usually in oxygen(in the air) producing  
heat, and usually light and fire
