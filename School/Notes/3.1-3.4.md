**Stoichiometry** (pronounced stoy-key-OM-uh-tree, roughly meaning “element measure” in Greek) is the area of study that examines the quantities of substances consumed and produced in chemical reactions

## Chemical Equations
We represent chemical reactions by **chemical equations**. When the gas hydrogen (H2) burns, for example, it reacts with oxygen (O2) in the air to form water (H2O). We write the chemical equation for this reaction as

$$2H_{2}+ O_{2} → 2H_{2}O$$

We read the + sign as “reacts with” and the arrow as “produces.” The chemical formulas to the _left_ of the arrow represent the starting substances, called **reactants**. The chemical formulas to the _right_ of the arrow represent substances produced in the reaction, called **products**. The numbers in front of the formulas, called coefficients, indicate the relative numbers of molecules of each kind involved in the reaction.

## Balancing Equations
### Writing Balanced Chemical Equations  
• According to the law of conservation of mass, all chemical equations must be  
balanced.  
• The total number of atoms of each element must be the same on the left-  
and right-hand side of the reaction arrow.  
• The masses of the products must equal the masses of the reactants

$$S(s) + O_2(g) → SO_2(g)  $$
Mass Ratio$$ 32.06 g + 32.00 g → 64.06 g$$

### Significance of a balanced chemical equation  
Qualitative: names of reactants and products  
Quantitative:  
1. Relative number of molecules of the reactants and product  
2. Relative number of moles  
3. Relative masses  
4. Relative volumes

## Steps to Balance Chemical Equations  
1. Write a preliminary expression containing a single particle (atom, molecule, or  
formula unit) of each reactant and product with a reaction arrow separating  
reactants from products. Include phase symbols indicating physical states.  
2. Check whether the expression is balanced by counting the atoms of each  
element on each side of the reaction arrow.  
3. Choose an element that appears in only one reactant and one product and  
balance it first.  
4. Choose coefficients for the other substances so that the number of atoms for  
each element is the same on both sides of the reaction arrow.  
5. Balance polyatomic ions (if present on both sides of the chemical equation) as a  
unit.

# 3.2 Simple Patterns of Chemical Reactivity

> [!Objective]
> **When you finish Section 3.2, you should be able to:**
> 
> - 3.2.1 Identify combination reactions and predict their reaction products.
>     
> - 3.2.2 Identify decomposition reactions and predict their reaction products.

There are many different types of chemical reactions.  
	Three broad classes of reactions can be predicted:  
	▪ Combination reactions  
	▪ Decomposition reactions  
	▪ Combustion reactions

## Combination Reactions
Two or more substances react to form one product
Hint: Use common charges for Groups)

##  Decomposition reactions 
One substance breaks down into two or more substances

## Combustion reactions
Combustion means burning, usually in oxygen(in the air) producing  
heat, and usually light and fire

# 3.3 Atomic Mass-Calculating Average Atomic Mass

The arbitrary standard that has been established for describing atomic mass is the atomic mass unit (amu or u), defined as one-twelfth of the mass of one atom of $^{12}C$ 

Carbon-12 = 12.00 amu (mass of 1 atom of carbon in atomic mass units)  
(1/12) of the mass of a carbon atom, 1 amu = $1.6605 *  10^{-24}$ g  
conversely: 1 gram =$6.02214 *  10^{23}$ amu

## Formula Weight  
The formula weight is used for ionic compounds.  
• The formula unit is used since there are no molecules present.  
For calcium chloride (CaCl2):  
1 Ca2+ ion  
1 formula unit × 40.078 u  
1 Ca2+ ion + 2 Cl− ions  
1 formula unit × 35.453 u  
1 Cl− ion = 110.984 u  
formula unit  
1(AW of Ca2+) + 2(AW of Cl-) = 110.98 amu

## Molecular Weight

The molecular weight is the sum of all the average atomic masses of the atoms that are chemically bonded together

## Percentage composition
- Every atom has percentile contribution in making of a compound.  
• Percentage contribution of a compound refers to the amount of various  
constituent elements present per 100 parts by mass on the substance

# 3.4 Mole Concept and Avogadro’s Number


207.2 amu of Pb = 1 atom of Pb
207.2 g = 1 mole of Pb


• 1 mole = 6.022 × 1023 particles (Avogadro’s constant, NA)  
• A mole is the number of atoms in exactly 12 grams of carbon-12

## Molar Mass  
A molar mass is the mass of 1 mol of a substance (i.e.,  
gram/mole) (atom, molecule, or formula unit).  
The formula weight (in amu) will be the same number as the  
molar mass (in gram/mol).  
One mole of atoms, ions, or molecules contains Avogadro’s  
number of those particles
