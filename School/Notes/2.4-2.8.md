# 2.4 Atomic Weight

> [!Objective]
> - 2.4.1 Describe the relationship between the atomic weight of an element and the weights and abundances of the naturally occurring isotopes of that element.
>     
> - 2.4.2 Interconvert between atomic weights and isotopic abundances for an element.

### Atomic Mass Unit (amu)

$$1 amu = 1.66054 *  10^{-24}g$$
and 

$$1g = 6.02214 * 10^{23} amu$$

---


mass number = p + n (whole number)

> [!NOTE]
> Atomic mass = $\sum\limits_{n}$ (fraction of isotopes n) * (mass of isotopes )

28 Si (92.23%), atomic mass 27.97693 amu;  
29 Si (4.68%), atomic mass 28.97649 amu; and
30 Si (3.09 %), atomic mass 29.97377  
amu. Calculate the atomic weight of silicon.%)

Si - 28 = .9223 *  27.97693 = a
Si - 29 = .0468 * 28.97649 = b
Si - 30 = .0309 * 29.97377  = c

average atomic mass = a + b + c

- Arranged in order of increasing atomic number
- Elements in columns have similar chemical and physical properties

# Groups
![[Pasted image 20230911114447.png]]

## Categories
- Metals
	- Shiny, solid, conductor (heat & electricity)
	- Malleable and ductile
	- Exception: Mercury (liquid)
	- Tend to lose electrons to form pos ions
- Nonmetals
	- Solids (brittle), liquids, and gases  
	-  Nonconductors  
	-  Tend to gain electrons in reactions with  
	metals to form negative ions  
	-  Often bond to each other by forming  
	covalent bond
- Metalloids
	-  Shiny (like metals) but brittle (like  
	nonmetals)  
	• Semiconductors

# 2.6 Molecules and Molecular Compounds

## Chemical Bonds

-   **Covalent bond**: Formed by sharing electrons between nonmetal atoms
	- Resulting collection of atoms is called a molecule, which can be represented in  
	the following ways:
			• Chemical formula  
			• [[Structural formula]]  
			• [[Space-filling model]]  
			• [[Ball-and-stick model]]

## Types of Formulas

- **Empirical formulas** give the _lowest_ whole-number ratio of atoms of each  
element in a compound.  
•  **Molecular formulas** give the _exact_ number of atoms of each element in  
a compound.  
• If we know the molecular formula of a compound, we can determine its  
empirical formula. The converse is not true without more information.

EX:
1. Molecular formula for hydrogen peroxide is H2O2. empirical formula is HO.
2. The molecular formula for ethylene is C2H4, so its empirical formula is CH2.

### Diatomic Molecules

These seven elements occur naturally as molecules containing two atoms:  
• Hydrogen ($H_2$)   
• Nitrogen ($N_2$)  
• Oxygen ($O_2$)   
• Fluorine ($F_2$)  
• Chlorine ($Cl_2$)  
• Bromine ($Br_2$)    
• Iodine ($I_2$)  

Note their location on the periodic table

## Ions

▪ **Ion**: Atom or group of atoms with a net positive or negative charge formed  by the loss or gain of electrons

---

[[Cation]]: _Positive ion_ formed by _losing_ electrons.  
• Monatomic cations are formed by _metals_

Cation formation: $$ Na → Na^{+} + e^{\color{#FF6666}-}$$

[[Anion]]: _Negative ion_ formed by _gaining_ electrons.  
• Monatomic anions are formed by _nonmetals_, except the noble gases

Anion formation: $$Cl + e^{-} → Cl^{-}$$

Charges of the common ions vary across the groups in the periodic table

## Ionic Bond, and Ionic Compounds

- Ionic compound: A compound composed of cations and anions
	- Ionic compounds are generally combinations of metals and nonmetal

>     
> - 2.8.2Interconvert between the name and chemical formula of an inorganic acid.
>     
> - 2.8.3Interconvert between the name and chemical formula of binary molecular compounds.
