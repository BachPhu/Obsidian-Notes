# 2.4 Atomic Weight

> [!Objective]
> - 2.4.1 Describe the relationship between the atomic weight of an element and the weights and abundances of the naturally occurring isotopes of that element.
>     
> - 2.4.2 Interconvert between atomic weights and isotopic abundances for an element.
>     
> - 2.4.3 Describe the principles of mass spectrometry.
>     
> - 2.4.4 Interpret/predict data from a mass spectrometer.

### Atomic Mass Unit (amu)

$$1 amu = 1.66054 *  10^{-24}g$$
and 

$$1g = 6.02214 * 10^{23} amu$$

---


mass number = p + n (whole number)

> [!NOTE]
> Atomic mass = $\sum\limits_{n}$ (fraction of isotopes n) * (mass of isotopes )

28 Si (92.23%), atomic mass 27.97693 amu;  
29 Si (4.68%), atomic mass 28.97649 amu; and
30 Si (3.09 %), atomic mass 29.97377  
amu. Calculate the atomic weight of silicon.%)

Si - 28 = .9223 *  27.97693 = a
Si - 29 = .0468 * 28.97649 = b
Si - 30 = .0309 * 29.97377  = c

average atomic mass = a + b + c

## Categories
- Metals
	- Shiny, solid, conductor (heat & electricity)
	- Malleable and ductile
	- Exception: Mercury (liquid)
	- Tend to lose electrons to form pos ions
- Nonmetals
	- Solids (brittle), liquids, and gases  
	-  Nonconductors  
	-  Tend to gain electrons in reactions with  
	metals to form negative ions  
	-  Often bond to each other by forming  
	covalent bond
- Metalloids
	-  Shiny (like metals) but brittle (like  
	nonmetals)  
	â€¢ Semiconductors
