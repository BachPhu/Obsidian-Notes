>     
> - 2.4.2 Interconvert between atomic weights and isotopic abundances for an element.

### Atomic Mass Unit (amu)

$$1 amu = 1.66054 *  10^{-24}g$$
and 

$$1g = 6.02214 * 10^{23} amu$$

---


mass number = p + n (whole number)

> [!NOTE]
> Atomic mass = $\sum\limits_{n}$ (fraction of isotopes n) * (mass of isotopes )

28 Si (92.23%), atomic mass 27.97693 amu;  
29 Si (4.68%), atomic mass 28.97649 amu; and
30 Si (3.09 %), atomic mass 29.97377  
amu. Calculate the atomic weight of silicon.%)

Si - 28 = .9223 *  27.97693 = a
Si - 29 = .0468 * 28.97649 = b
Si - 30 = .0309 * 29.97377  = c

average atomic mass = a + b + c

- Arranged in order of increasing atomic number
- Elements in columns have similar chemical and physical properties

# Groups
![[Pasted image 20230911114447.png]]

## Categories
- Metals
	- Shiny, solid, conductor (heat & electricity)
	- Malleable and ductile
	- Exception: Mercury (liquid)
	- Tend to lose electrons to form pos ions
- Nonmetals
	- Solids (brittle), liquids, and gases  
	-  Nonconductors  
	-  Tend to gain electrons in reactions with  
	metals to form negative ions  
	-  Often bond to each other by forming  
	covalent bond
- Metalloids
	-  Shiny (like metals) but brittle (like  
	nonmetals)  
	• Semiconductors

# 2.6 Molecules and Molecular Compounds

## Chemical Bonds

-   **Covalent bond**: Formed by sharing electrons between nonmetal atoms
	- Resulting collection of atoms is called a molecule, which can be represented in  
	the following ways:
			• Chemical formula  
			• [[Structural formula]]  
			• [[Space-filling model]]  
			• [[Ball-and-stick model]]
	![[Pasted image 20230911130431.png]]

## Types of Formulas

- **Empirical formulas** give the _lowest_ whole-number ratio of atoms of each  
element in a compound.  
•  **Molecular formulas** give the _exact_ number of atoms of each element in  
a compound.  
• If we know the molecular formula of a compound, we can determine its  
empirical formula. The converse is not true without more information.

EX:
1. Molecular formula for hydrogen peroxide is H2O2. empirical formula is HO.
2. The molecular formula for ethylene is C2H4, so its empirical formula is CH2.

### Diatomic Molecules

These seven elements occur naturally as molecules containing two atoms:  
• Hydrogen ($H_2$)   
• Nitrogen ($N_2$)  
• Oxygen ($O_2$)   
• Fluorine ($F_2$)  
• Chlorine ($Cl_2$)  
• Bromine ($Br_2$)    
• Iodine ($I_2$)  

Note their location on the periodic table

## Ions

▪ **Ion**: Atom or group of atoms with a net positive or negative charge formed  by the loss or gain of electrons

---

[[Cation]]: _Positive ion_ formed by _losing_ electrons.  
• Monatomic cations are formed by _metals_

Cation formation: $$ Na → Na^{+} + e^{\color{#FF6666}-}$$
![[Pasted image 20230911133128.png | 300]]

[[Anion]]: _Negative ion_ formed by _gaining_ electrons.  
• Monatomic anions are formed by _nonmetals_, except the noble gases

Anion formation: $$Cl + e^{-} → Cl^{-}$$
![[Pasted image 20230911133230.png | 300]]
### Charges
Charges of the common ions vary across the groups in the periodic table

## Ionic Bond, and Ionic Compounds

- Ionic compound: A compound composed of cations and anions
	- Ionic compounds are generally combinations of metals and nonmetal

> [!Objective]
> **When you finish Section 2.8, you should be able to:**
> 
> - 2.8.1Interconvert between the name and empirical formula of an ionic compound.
>     
> - 2.8.2Interconvert between the name and chemical formula of an inorganic acid.
>     
> - 2.8.3Interconvert between the name and chemical formula of binary molecular compounds.

The system used in naming substances is called **chemical nomenclature**


• There are rules used to name  
1) Ionic compounds  
2) Acids  
3) Binary molecular compounds  

# Ionic compound
## Cations 

a) Main group metals
![[Pasted image 20230913120640.png|200]]

b) Cations with different charges  
![[Pasted image 20230913120816.png]]

c) Cations formed from molecules composed of nonmetal atoms have names that end in -ium:
$NH{_4} ^+$ ammonium; H3O+ Hydronium  

## Anions
a) Monoatomic Anions
![[Pasted image 20230913121146.png |200]]

b) Compounds 
- Compound are always neutral (balance the charge)
- The cation is named before the anion.

• Write the element name of the cation.  
	▪ If the cation can have more than one  
	possible charge, write the charge as a  
	Roman numeral in parentheses

---
  

> [!Important]
>- If the element is the **monoatomic anion**,  
> change its ending to _–ide_
> 
>- If the anion is a **polyatomic ion**, simply write: the name of the polyatomic ion +
> smaller number  _-ite_ (even)
> larger number _-ate_ (odd)

## Binary Compounds  
• Composed of two elements  
• Include covalent and ionic compounds

Contain a cation, which is written first in the formula, and an anion 

![[Pasted image 20230913122836.png | 280]]

### Binary Ionic Compounds containing metal that forms more than one kind of cation (variable charge)  
 
_Nomenclature for metals that form more than one type of cation_
	• Charge of the metal cation is indicated by a Roman numeral  
	• Common metals that don’t require Roman numerals  
		• Silver, Zinc, and Cadmium (Ag+, $Zn^{2+}$, and $Cd^{2+}$ )

![[Pasted image 20230913123943.png |380]]


_Alternative nomenclature_
• Ion with the higher charge has a name ending in -ic, and the one with the lower  
charge has a name ending in -ous

![[Pasted image 20230913123913.png]]

## Nomenclature of Binary Molecular (Covalent) Compounds

* [n] NO NEED for balance charges

- Formed between two nonmetals  
• First element: the element farther to the left in the periodic  
table (closer to the metals) or lower in the same group
  
Naming binary covalent compounds  
• Prefixes are used to denote the numbers of atoms present  
• Prefix mono- is never used for naming the first elememt

The ending on the second element is changed to-ide

# Acids
all acid has H as $H^+$ ion in aqueous solution.

$H_{2}(\color{#84C1FF}aq)$ - aq means acid
## Inorganic Acid Nomenclature

Molecules in which one or more $H^{+}$ are attached to an anion

- If the anion ends in _-ide_, the acid is named with the  
prefix hydro- and the suffix _–ic_

- If the anion ends in _-ate_, change the ending to  _-ic_
acid

![[Screen Shot 2023-09-15 at 12.22.14 AM.png | 400]]
  
- If the anion ends in _-ite_, change the ending to _-ous_  
acid

# A Flowchart for Naming Binary Compounds
Rules for naming ionic compounds containing polyatomic ions are the same as binary ionic compounds.  
• That is, write the name of the cation  
followed by the name of the anion.  
• For cations with variable charge, keep  
the roman numeral in the  
compound's name.
