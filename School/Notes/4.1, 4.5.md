# Solutions  
• What is a Solution?  
Example:  
• **Solute**: Substance being dissolved  
• **Solvent**: Dissolving medium  
• Aqueous solution

# 4.1 Aqueous Solutions (aq)

## Water, the Common Solvent-Aqueous solutions
- Polarity of Water facilitates its ability to dissolve many compound
## Solubility of Substances in Water

Like dissolves like is a useful rule for predicting solubility  
• All substances dissolve by _solvation_, surrounding of the solute by solvent.  
	• This process stabilizes the ions in solution.  

• If the solvent is Water, the process is called _Hydration_.  

- [6] In hydration process:  
• Positive ends of H2O molecules are attracted to negatively charged anions  
• Negative ends of H2O molecules are attracted to positively charged cations

## How Compounds Dissolve in Water

- [7] Substances can dissolve in water by different ways:
### Ionic Substances
• Causes salts to dissolve  
	• Strong forces present among the positive and negative ions of the solid are replaced by strong  water–ion interactions

Example  
• Sodium chloride is quite soluble in water, whereas silver chloride, which contains Ag+ and Cl– ions, is only slightly soluble

### Molecular Substances

Molecular compounds disperse in water, but most remain intact
- Some molecular substances form ions in water when they dissolve

Example
- Acids

## Electrical Conductivity

- _Electrical conductance_ is an electrical phenomenon where a material contains movable particles with electric charge which can carry  
electricity.  
• When a difference of electrical potential is placed across a conductor, its electrons flow, and an electric current appears.

## The nature of aqueous solutions: Electrolytes

Electrical Conductivity of Aqueous Solutions  
• Ability of a solution to conduct electric current  
	• Pure water is not an electrical conductor  

- [8] **Electrolyte**: Substance that can conduct electricity when it is dissolved in water, or in melten state.  

Svante Arrhenius (1859–1927)  
• Identified the basis for the conductivity properties of solutions  
• Postulated that the extent to which a solution can conduct an electric current directly depends on the number of ions present

---

## Electrolytes

- [2] An **electrolyte** is a substance that conduct an electric current in either aqueous solution or when melted

Example: $NaCl(s)$ and $CH_{3}CO_{2}H(aq)$

- [9] A **non-electrolyte** is a substance that does not conduct an electric current in either aqueous solution or when melted.  
- [n] The solutions of non-electrolytes do not have ions. The solution does NOT dissociate  
into ions

---
### Strong and weak electrolytes

#### Strong electrolytes

**Strong electrolytes** : A substance (strong acids, strong bases, and mostly salt) that is completely ionized in solution
- [n] Strong electrolytes are those solutes that exist in solution completely or nearly completely as ions.

Examples:

Soluble salts 

Strong acide

Strong bases

- 6 strong bases acid and the rest are weak

---

#### Weak electrolytes  

**Weak electrolytes**: A substance that only partly ionizes in solution
- [n] Weak electrolytes are those solutes that exist in solution mostly in the form of neutral molecules with only a small fraction in the form of ions

• Exhibit a small degree of ionization in water (incomplete  
ionization)  
• Non-acidic hydrogen atoms are written later (if present)

# 4.5. Composition of Solutions: Concentration and Molarity

Binary Solution:  
Homogeneous mixture of two components  
**Solution: solvent + solute**

## Molarity (M)
  
- We call the amount dissolved its _concentration_.  
- Molarity is one way to measure the concentration of a solution:  
- Defined as moles of solute per in one liter(1000mL) solution
- Molarity can also be used as a conversion factor between moles and liters

$$M \text{ = molarity = }\frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{liters of solution}}$$
Moles of solute = mass / molar mass
1L = 1000 mL

## Standard Solution

Solution whose concentration is accurately known  
• Process of preparation  
	• Place a weighed amount of the solute into a volumetric flask, and  add a small amount of water 
	• Dissolve the solid by swirling the flask with the stopper in place  
	• Add more water until the level of the solution reaches the mark etched on the neck of the flask 
	• Mix the solution by inverting the flask several times

## Dilution

- Process of adding water to a concentrated (stock) solution to achieve the molarity desired for a particular solution  
• Central idea behind performing calculations associated with dilution is to ascertain that the moles of solute are not changed by the dilution  
	• Only water is added to accomplish the dilution

> [!Important]
> The molarity of the new solution can be determined from the equation
> $$M_{c}\times V_{c}= M_{d}\times V_{d}$$
> $M_{c} \text{ and } V_{c}$ - Molarity and volume of the original (concentrated) solution
> $M_{d} \text{ and } V_{d}$ - Molarity and volume of the diluted solution

> [!Remember]
> 
> $$M_\times V\text{(in L) = moles}$$
> which is $\frac{mol}{L} \times L = mol$ 

Points to Note:  
• A solution can be diluted by adding Only solvent.  
• The concentration is Lower.  
• The Moles don’t change.
