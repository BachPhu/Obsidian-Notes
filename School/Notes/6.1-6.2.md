# Electronic Structure
Electronic structure—the arrangement and energy of electrons.  
- It may seem odd to start by talking about waves. However, extremely small particles have properties that can only be explained in this manner.  
- The discoveries of Planck, Einstein, de Broglie, and Heisenberg, showed that matter and energy share common wave-like and particle-like properties  
- These discoveries led to the development of a new field of physics called quantum mechanics

# 6.1 The Wave Nature of Light

> [!Objective]
> 
> - 6.1.1 Identify the different types of electromagnetic radiation and arrange them in order of their relative wavelength or frequency.  
> - 6.1.2 Use appropriate equations to calculate related light-wave properties such as frequency, and wavelength

Electromagnetic Radiation

- To understand the electronic structure of atoms, one must understand the nature of _electromagnetic radiation_.  
- **Electromagnetic radiation** moves as waves through space at the speed of light.  
- The distance between corresponding points on adjacent waves is the _wavelength_( $\lambda$ ).

Wavelength (λ): 
Frequency (ν):  
speed (velocity, c):

Wavelength and frequency are inversely related

$$\lambda \propto \frac{1}{v}$$
$$\lambda v = c$$
$$v= \frac{c}{v}$$

**Wavenumber**: Number of wavelength per unit length
$$\overline {v} = \frac{1}{\text{wave length}}$$

**Amplitude**: Defined as height of wave i.e., crest or trough

Electromagnetic spectrum is a continuous range of radiant energy that includes gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet radiation, visible light, infrared radiation, and radio waves.

- All electromagnetic radiation travels at the same velocity:

- [n] The speed of light, c, is $2.9979×10^{8}$ m/

# 6.2 Quantized Energy and Photons

Three observed properties associated with how atoms interact with electromagnetic radiation cannot be explained by waves:  
1) The emission of light from hot objects (blackbody radiation)  
2) The emission of electrons from metal surfaces on which light is shone (the photoelectric effect)  
3) Emission of light from electronically excited gas atoms (emission spectra)

## Quantum Theory: Blackbody Radiation

- An object glows when heated.  
- The wave nature of light  does not explain how an  object can glow when its temperature increases. 
-  Classical physics predicted emission of UV, X-rays, and gamma rays. They were not observed

### Max Planck’s Quantum Theory: Blackbody Radiation

Postulated that energy can be gained or lost only in whole-number multiples of an elementary unit  (quantum, hν)

- [n] Planck’s constant = h = 6.626×10–34 J · s
