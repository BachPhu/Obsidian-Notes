# Molecules and Molecular Compounds

Atoms can combine to form **molecules**. Compounds composed of molecules (**molecular compounds**) usually contain only nonmetallic elements. A molecule that contains two atoms is called a **diatomic molecule**. The composition of a substance is given by its **chemical formula**. A molecular substance can be represented by its **empirical formula**, which gives the relative numbers of atoms of each kind, but is usually represented by its **molecular formula**, which gives the actual numbers of each type of atom in a molecule. **Structural formulas** show the order in which the atoms in a molecule are connected. **Ball-and-stick models** and **space-filling models** convey additional information about the shapes of molecules.

# Ions and Ionic Compounds

Atoms can either gain or lose electrons, forming charged particles called **ions**. Metals tend to lose electrons, becoming positively charged ions (**cations**). Nonmetals tend to gain electrons, forming negatively charged ions (**anions**). Because **ionic compounds** are electrically neutral, containing both cations and anions, they usually contain both metallic and nonmetallic elements. Atoms that are joined together, as in a molecule, but carry a net charge are called **polyatomic ions**. The chemical formulas used for ionic compounds are empirical formulas, which can be written readily if the charges of the ions are known. The total positive charge of the cations in an ionic compound must equal the total negative charge of the anions.

## Naming Inorganic Compounds

The set of rules for naming chemical compounds is called **chemical nomenclature**. We studied the systematic rules used for naming three classes of inorganic substances: ionic compounds, inorganic acids, and binary molecular compounds. In naming an ionic compound, the cation is named first and then the anion. Cations formed from metal atoms have the same name as the metal. If the metal can form cations of differing charges, the charge is indicated using Roman numerals. Monatomic anions have names ending in _ide_. Polyatomic anions containing oxygen and another element (**oxyanions**) have names ending in _ate_ or _ite_. In naming binary molecular compounds, Greek prefixes are used to denote the number of each element in the molecular formula, and the element farthest to the left in the periodic table (closest to metallic elements) is generally written first.
