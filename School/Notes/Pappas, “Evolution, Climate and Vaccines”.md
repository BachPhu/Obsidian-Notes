- Context: Research pull of Pew and Gallup suggest that the public reject evolutions, science conclusion
- Claim: but there're evidence showed otherwise, for ex: 75% are in favor of taxpayer funded science research. and the debate of public rejecting science was oversimplified
- deny because of reason like: to protect their social identity
- "Kahan's research has also shown that the more science-literate people are, the more strongly they hold to their beliefs — even if those [beliefs are totally wrong](https://www.livescience.com/44792-what-science-communicators-can-learn-from-listening-to-people.html)."
- not because misunderstand but more about protecting personal opinion
- why protect it if it wrong? it might be going against their benefit/interest, their image
-  some ppl just go w what majority ppl around them believe in
- scientist try to change public attitude w "psychological jiujitsu". try to get to the root of the disbelief and address the basis rather than surface denial. 
- Some might not know why they think the way they do 
- "A two-tiered strategy would be optimal: scientific consensus that should be sufficient for the majority, and a jiujitsu approach for the unconvinced minority,
- try not to criticize ppl, be inclusive(?)
