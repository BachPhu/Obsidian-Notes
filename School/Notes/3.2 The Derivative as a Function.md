# The Derivative as a Function

The derivative funciton denoted by f', is the function whose domain consist of those x values such that the following limit exists:
$$ f'(x) = \lim_{h â†’ 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)} {h}
$$
- f is differentiable at a if f'(a) exists
- f is a differentiable at a if f'(x) exists on the whole domain of f(x)

EX: A ball shot in the air that has a velocity given by $v(t) = (20 -32t) ft/s$ Determine the height of the platform given that the ball hits the ground after 2s

$$x(t) = \int v(t) = 20t -16t^{2} 
$$

$$0 = x(2) = 20(2) -16(2)^{2}+ C $$
$$ = -24 +C$$$$C = 24$$$$x(0) = 20(0) -16(0)^{2}+ 24$$
$$ = 24ft$$
