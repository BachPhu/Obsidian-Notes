- [?] Why do we need "limit" in Calculus?
1. The tangent problem
2. The area problem

### The tangent problem

Formular for the secant line through (a, f(a)) , (b, f(b)) :

$$m_{sec}= \frac{f(b) - f(c)}{b-a}$$
slope = m

[[Point-Slope Form]]:
$$y - f(a) = m_{sec}(x-a)$$

---

$$f'(a) = \lim_{b â†’ a} \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a} =m_{sec}
$$

#### The area problem
