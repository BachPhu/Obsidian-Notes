# 4.2 Precipitation reactions  

> [!Objective]
> 4.2.1 Predict whether a compound is soluble or insoluble in water.  
> 4.2.2 Predict whether a precipitation reaction will occur when two aqueous solutions are mixed.  
> 4.2.3 Write balanced chemical equations including phases for metathesis reactions.  
> 4.2.4 Convert balanced molecular equations into full and net ionic equations

**Precipitation Reaction** occurs when two aqueous solutions (solutions with soluble salts) are mixed, and an insoluble salt, _precipitate_ separates from the solution  
• Precipitate: Insoluble solid

## Solubility of Ionic Compounds

- [n] Not all ionic compounds totally dissolve in water.  
 
- Solubility of ionic compounds varies greatly, and differences depend on:  
	- Relative attraction of ions for each other  
	- Attraction of ions for water molecules  

Example:
Sodium chloride is quite soluble in water, whereas silver chloride, which contains Ag+ and Cl– ions, is only slightly soluble  

- [*] Predicting whether a compound will dissolve in water is done by empirical method. 
- [*] A list of solubility rules is used to decide what combination of ions will dissolve.  

###  [[Solubility Rules]]

- Given two compound, one of them must be precipitate by crossing ionic. which means reaction happen(if there're two precipitate then no reaction happens)


## How to Predict Whether a Precipitate Forms When Strong Electrolytes Are Mixed

- [8] Metathesis (Exchange) Reactions || (Double Displacement Reactions)

The anions in the reactant compounds exchange, or transpose.

$$\color{#84C1FF}AX  \color{#C7CFEE}(aq) + \color{#FF6666}BY \color{#C7CFEE}(aq) → \color{#84C1FF}A \color{#FF6666}Y \color{#C7CFEE}+ \color{#FF6666}B\color{#84C1FF}X$$

> [!Steps]
> Steps to follow:
> 1) Note the ions present in the reactants.  
> 2) Consider the possible cation-anion combinations and write the formulas for the products. Use charges to write proper subscripts.  
> 3) Use Solubility Rules to determine if any of the combinations is insoluble.  
> 	• One of the two resulting combinations must be a precipitate for the reaction to occur.  
> 	• If no precipitate forms, No Reaction occurs between the two solutions mixed.  
> 4) Balance the equation

## Summarizing Aqueous Equations

• A **molecular equation** is a chemical equation showing the complete, neutral formulas  
for every compound in a reaction.  
• A **complete ionic equation** is a chemical equation showing all of the species as they  
are actually present in solution: strong electrolytes are therefore represented as their  
component ions.  
• A **net ionic equation** is an equation showing only the species that actually change  
during the reaction.  
- _Spectator ions_: The ions crossed out are called spectator ions because they do not  
participate in the reaction (soluble salts, strong acids, and strong bases)

# 4.3 Acids, Bases, and Neutralization

> [!Objectives]
> 4.3.2 Predict whether a compound is an acid or a base based on its chemical formula/structure.  
> 4.3.3 Differentiate between strong and weak acids/bases.  
> 4.3.5 Write balanced chemical equations for neutralization reactions.

## Acids, Bases, and Neutralization

- [9] Acids  
Arrhenius Theory  
• An acid is a substance that will dissolve and ionize in water to yield hydrogen ions, H+.  
• Acid: Proton donor (Brønsted–Lowry definition)  
• As an example, consider the equation shown here

$$HCl(aq)+H2O(aq)→Cl^−(aq)+ H^+(aq)$$
- [8] Bases  
Arrhenius Theory  
• A base is a substance that will dissolve in water to yield hydroxide ions,  
OH−.  
• Base: Proton acceptor (Brønsted–Lowry definition)  
• The most common bases are ionic compounds composed of alkali  
or alkaline earth metal cations (groups 1 and 2) combined with  
the hydroxide ion

### Strong acids and Weak acids

![[Screen Shot 2023-10-09 at 12.23.00 AM.png|300]]

- [n] Strong acids completely dissociate in water  
	$HNO_{3}(aq) + H_{2}O(aq) → NO_3^−(aq) + H^+(aq)$  
- [n] Weak acids only partially dissociate.  
	$HCH_{3}CO_{2}H(aq) + H_{2}O(l) ⇌ CH_{3}CO_{2}^−(aq) + H_{3}O^+(aq)$

**Polyprotic acids** contain more than one ionizable proton and release them sequentially
H3C6H5O7-Citric acid 
H2C6H6O6-Ascorbic acid (Vit.C)
### Strong Bases and Weak Bases

![[Screen Shot 2023-10-12 at 3.56.51 PM.png | 300]]
- [n] Strong Bases completely dissociate in water  
	$Ba(OH)_2(s) → Ba^{2+}(aq) + 2OH^{-}(aq)$  
- [n] Weak bases only partially dissociate.  
	$NH_{3}(aq) +H_{2}O(l) ⇌ NH^{+4}(aq) +OH^−(aq)$

- [7] Neutralization Reaction

- Acid–base reactions are often called _neutralization reactions _
- Acid is neutralized when enough base is added to react exactly with the acid in the solution. 
- The reactions occur when the anion from one reactant combines with the cation of the other

- [n] acid + base → salt + water

## Acid–Base Titrations

- [*] **Volumetric analysis**: Technique used for ascertaining the amount of a certain substance by doing a titration  
- [*] **Titration**: A _titration_ is a laboratory procedure where a substance in a solution of known concentration (_titrant_) is reacted with another substance in a solution of unknown concentration (_analyte_)

## Acid–Base Titrations: Equivalence (Stoichiometric) Point  

• Point in titration where enough titrant has been added to react exactly with the analyte  

- [*] **Equivalence point**: equivalence point is a point in the titration when  
From the reactants are in their stoichiometric ratio and are completely reacted.  
	• The moles of titrant (standard solution) equal the moles of the solution with unknown concentration. -stoichiometric point  

- [*] **Indicator**: Used to mark the equivalence point  
	• Substance added at the beginning of the titration that changes color at the equivalence point based on the acidity or basicity of the solution  

- [*] **Endpoint**: Point where the indicator changes color  
	• Occurs exactly at the equivalence point-for strong acid and strong base reaction.+ −  
	H and OH  

### Requirements for a Successful Titration

- Exact reaction between titrant and analyte must be known  
• Stoichiometric (equivalence) point must be marked accurately  
• Volume of titrant required to reach the stoichiometric point must be known accurately  
• Phenolphthalein: Colorless in an acidic solution and pink in a basic solution

### <mark class="hltr-light-purple">Problem-Solving Strategy - Performing Calculations for Acid–Base Reactions</mark>
1. Write the balanced equation for the reaction  
2. Calculate moles of the given reactant using the volumes of the original solutions and their molarities  
3. Calculate the moles of the required reactant or product
4. Convert to volume or Molarity (of solution), as required

# 4.4 Oxidation–Reduction (Redox) Reactions



> [!Objectives]
> 4.3.1 Determine the oxidation numbers (also called oxidation states) of elements in a compound.  
> 4.4.2 Identify which species are oxidized and which are reduced in an oxidation–reduction  
> reaction.  
> 4.4.4 Use the activity series to predict oxidation–reduction reactions between a metal.  

  ---
  
- Involve the transfer of one or more electrons

- Example 1  
	• Combustion reactions, which provide most of the energy to power human civilization 

• Example 2  
	• Reaction of metal and non-metal with electron transfer

---

- Loss of electrons is _oxidation_.  
- Gain of electrons is _reduction_.  
- One cannot occur without the other.  
- The reactions are often called _redox reactions_ 

---

## Oxidation States (Oxidation Numbers)  
- To determine if an oxidation–reduction reaction has occurred, we assign an oxidation number to each element in a neutral compound or charged entity

- This is a “bookkeeping” method—it does Not imply that the atoms have these charges
---

## Rules to Assign Oxidation Numbers 

1) Atoms in their elemental form have an oxidation number of zero
                   Na(s), Fe(s), H (g), O (g)N (g), Cl (g)2        Cu = 0 and Cl = 0
2) The oxidation number of a monatomic ion is the same as its charge
3) Nonmetals usually have negative oxidation numbers, although they sometimes can be positive:
	- Oxygen: usually -2; in peroxide, -1  
	- Hydrogen: +1; and -1 when bonded to metals  
	- Fluorine: -1  
	- Other halogens: usually -1, in Oxyanions they will have +1, +3, +5, +7
4) For electrically neutral compounds, the sum of oxidation numbers is zero
5) The sum of the oxidation numbers in a polyatomic ion is equal to the charge of the ion.
	The charge of a polyatomic ion is a property of the entire ion, while the oxidation  
	states are assigned to each individual atom

## Identifying Oxidation–Reduction Reactions  

- Oxidation–reduction reactions are characterized by a transfer of electrons

- **Oxidation**: Increase in oxidation state  
• Characterized by loss of electrons  
• **Oxidizing agent**: Electron acceptor .  
• The reactant that causes oxidation in another reactant is called the _oxidizing agent_

- **Reduction**: Decrease in oxidation state  
• Characterized by gain of electrons  
• **Reducing agent**: Electron donor.  
• The reactant that causes reduction in another reactant is called the _reducing agent_.

---
## Guidelines for Oxidizing and Reducing Agents  
Redox reactions:  
• Any reaction in which there is a change in the oxidation states of atoms  in going from reactants to products.  

In a redox reaction:  
• The oxidizing agent oxidizes another substance (and is itself reduced).  
• The reducing agent reduces another substance (and is itself oxidized).

---
## Activity Series to Determine Spontaneity

• __Activity series of metals__ is a table listing metals in order of decreasing tendency to lose electrons. 
	• Metals at the top have higher tendency to undergo oxidation, most  reactive.  
	• Metals at the bottom have the least tendency to undergo oxidation, least reactive.  

• Each reaction in the activity series is an oxidation half-reaction.  

## Activity Series
- The elements above hydrogen will react with acids to produce hydrogen gas. Elements below will Not react
