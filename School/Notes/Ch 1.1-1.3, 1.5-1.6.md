- [*] **1.1** **The Study of Chemistry** Learn what chemistry is, what atoms and molecules are, and why it is useful to study chemistry.
    
- [*] **1.2** **Classifications of Matter** Examine fundamental ways to classify matter; distinguish between _pure substances_ and _mixtures_, and between _elements_ and _compounds_.

---
# 1.1
- **Matter** is physical material (occupies space and has mass)
- A **property** is characteristic of a particular type of matter and distinguish it from other types
---
### Atom
- An atom is the smallest particle of an element that cannot be  
chemically or mechanically divided into smaller particles
- Properties of a substance can be determined by the kinds of atoms  
(**composition**) and the way in which atoms are organized (**structure**) in  
that substance

---
### Molecule
- In a **molecule**, two or more atoms are joined in specific geometrical arrangement 
	- attachments are called bonds  
	- attachments come in different strengths  
	- come in different shapes and patterns  

---
### Fundamental Concepts of Chemistry  
▪ Matter is composed of various types of atoms  
▪ By reorganizing the way, the atoms are attached to each other,  
one substance changes to another

> [!Objective]
> - 1.2.1 Compare and contrast the different states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas.
>     
> - 1.2.2 Distinguish among elements, compounds, and mixtures.
>     
> - 1.2.3 Identify the atomic symbols of common elements.

## States of Matter

- State of Matter - state of matter that can be assume: gas, liquid, solid
	- A **gas** (also known as vapor) has no fixed volume or shape. Can be compressed to occupy a smaller volume, or it can expand to occupy a larger one.
	- A **liquid** has a distinct volume, shape of its container, shape of it container, not easy to compress
	- A **solid** has both a definite shape and a definite volume and is not easily compressed.

- Compress a gas is decreases the amount of space and increase the frequency of collisions between molecules, not alter size or shape.

- In a liquid, the molecules are packed closely together but still move rapidly and slide over another. Gas, molecules far apart but move at high speed. Solid, held tight together and mostly stay in place (some can wiggle).
---
## Pure Substances

- A **pure substance** (usually referred to simply as a _substance_) is made up of only one  
component, and its composition is invariant
	-  Water and table salt (sodium chloride) are examples of pure substances.

> [!NOTE]
> - [*]  All *substances* are either <font color = #84C1FF> elements </font>  or compounds.
> 
> 	- <font color = #84C1FF >Elements </font> are substances that cannot be decomposed into simpler substances. On the molecular level, each element is composed of only one kind of atom (Figure 1.4(a) and (b) ).
> 	    
> 	- **Compounds** are substances composed of two or more elements; they contain two or more kinds of atoms (Figure 1.4(c))

- **Mixtures** are combinations of two or more substances in which each substance retains its chemical identity.

## Compounds
- Most elements can interact with other elements to form compounds.
	- For example, when hydrogen gas burns in oxygen gas, the elements hydrogen and oxygen combine to form the compound water.

The elements hydrogen and oxygen themselves exist naturally as _diatomic_ (two-atom) molecules:

---
## Mixture

Most of the matter we encounter consists of mixtures of different substances. Each substance in a mixture retains its chemical identity and properties. In contrast to a pure substance, which by definition has a fixed composition, the composition of a mixture can vary. A cup of sweetened coffee, for example, can contain either a little sugar or a lot. The substances making up a mixture are called _components_ of the mixture.

- **Solution** mixture of substance that has uniform composition; a homogeneous mixture.

## Classification of Matter

> [!Important]
> The two fundamental ways in which matter is classified  
> - Physical state  
> - Composition

![[Pasted image 20230825000806.png]]

- **heterogeneous** - Mixtures do not have the same composition, properties, and appearance throughout. (EX: rocks, woods)
- _homogeneous_ - Mixtures that are uniform throughout. Also called solution (EX: soda, air)

## The Organization of Matter based on Composition  
![[Screen Shot 2023-08-26 at 8.35.22 PM.png]]

## Types of Properties of Substances  

▪ Physical properties can be observed without changing the  
identity and composition of the substance.  
	• These properties include color, odor, density, melting point, boiling point, and hardness.  
	- no change in composition

▪ Chemical properties describe the way a substance may change,  
or react, to form other substances.  
	• Flammability  
	- chang in composition
	
▪ Intensive properties do not depend on the quantity (amount) of  
the sample  
	• boiling point, color, etc.  
	
▪ Extensive properties depend on the amount of the sample.  
	• mass, volume, etc.

## Temperature

- The **Celsius scale** was originally based on the assignment of 0 °C to the freezing point of water and 100 °C to its boiling point at sea level

- The **Kelvin scale** is the SI temperature scale, and the SI unit of temperature is the _kelvin_ (K). Zero on the Kelvin scale is the temperature at which all thermal motion ceases, a temperature referred to as **absolute zero**. On the Celsius scale, absolute zero has the value −273.15 °C.

> [!NOTE]
> $$ K = C + 273.15$$

- The freezing point of water, 0 °C, is 273.15 K
---
## Derived SI Units

The SI base units are used to formulate _derived units_. A **derived unit** is obtained by multiplication or division of one or more of the base units.


**Density** is defined as the amount of mass in a unit volume of a substance:

$$density = \frac{mass}{volume}$$


- [n] change in temperature changes volume

---

## Units of Energy

- The SI unit for energy is the **joule** (pronounced “jool”), J. 
- units of energy are $(mass)×(velocity)^2$
- Because a joule is not a very large amount of energy, we often use _kilojoules_ (kJ) in discussing the energies associated with chemical reactions

A **calorie** (cal) was originally defined as the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 g of water from 14.5 to 15.5 °C. It has since been defined in terms of a joule:

$$1 cal = 4.184 J (exactly)$$
1 Cal = 1000 cal = 1 kcal.

## Exact and Inexact Numbers

Two kinds of numbers are encountered in scientific work: _exact numbers_ (those whose values are known exactly) and _inexact numbers_ (those whose values have some uncertainty)

*Certain digits*
	▪ Numbers that remain the same regardless of who measures  
them  
*Uncertain digits*  
	▪ Digits that must be estimated and therefore vary  
	
▪ While reporting a measurement, record all certain digits  
plus the first uncertain digit  

### Measurement of Volume Using a Burette  
▪ Volume is read at the bottom of the liquid  
curve, which is called the meniscus  
▪ Meniscus of the liquid occurs at about 20.15 mL  
	- Certain digits - 20.1  
	- Uncertain digit - 20.1*5*

EX: Ruler A has no mark, Ruler B has cm marks
A can only have 2 sig. fig.
B can have 3 sig. fig.

# Precision and Accuracy

- **Precision** is a measure of how closely individual measurements agree with one another. 

- **Accuracy** refers to how closely individual measurements agree with the correct, or “true,” value.
![[Pasted image 20230826222400.png | 100]]

The precision of the measurements is often expressed in terms of the _standard deviation_ (Appendix A.5), which reflects how much the individual measurements differ from the average.

---
## Types of Errors

- Random error (intermediate error)  
	▪ Measurement has an equal probability of being low or high  
	▪ Occurs in estimating the value of the last digit of a  
	measurement  
	▪ More trials and standard deviation  
- Systematic error (determinate error)  
	▪ Occurs in the same direction each time  
	▪ Either always high or always low

# Significant Figures




- Uncertainty in the last number is always assumed to be ±1 unless  
otherwise indicated
You could report the mass as 2.2405 ± 0.0001 g. The ± notation (read “plus or minus”) expresses the magnitude of the uncertainty of your measurement. In much scientific work, we drop the ± notation with the understanding that _there is always some uncertainty in the last digit reported for any measured quantity._

### Rules for Counting Significant Figures (1 of 3)

1. Nonzero integers: All nonzero digits are significant.  
2. Zeros - There are three classes of zeros  
▪ Leading zeros  
▪ Captive zeros  
	- Zeros _between_ nonzero digits are always significant—1005 kg (four significant figures); 7.03 cm (three significant figures).
▪ Trailing zeros
	- Zeros _at the end_ of a number are significant if the number contains a decimal point 0.0200 g (three significant figures); 3.0 cm (two significant figures);  1200.
3. Exact numbers  
▪ Determined by counting and not by using a measuring  
device  
▪ Assumed to have an infinite number of significant figures
