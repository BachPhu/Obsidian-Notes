- [*] **1.1** **The Study of Chemistry** Learn what chemistry is, what atoms and molecules are, and why it is useful to study chemistry.
    
- [*] **1.2** **Classifications of Matter** Examine fundamental ways to classify matter; distinguish between _pure substances_ and _mixtures_, and between _elements_ and _compounds_.

---
# 1.1
- **Matter** is physical material
- A **property** is characteristic of a particular type of matter and distinguish it from other types
- In a **molecule**, two or more atoms are joined in specific shapes

# 1.2

> [!Objective]
> - 1.2.1 Compare and contrast the different states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas.
>     
> - 1.2.2 Distinguish among elements, compounds, and mixtures.
>     
> - 1.2.3 Identify the atomic symbols of common elements.

## States of Matter

- State of Matter - state of matter that can be assume: gas, liquid, solid
	- A **gas** (also known as vapor) has no fixed volume or shape. Can be compressed to occupy a smaller volume, or it can expand to occupy a larger one.
	- A **liquid** has a distinct volume independent of its container, shape of it container, not easy to compress
	- A **solid** has both a definite shape and a definite volume and is not easily compressed.

- Compress a gas is decreases the amount of space and increase the frequency of collisions between molecules, not alter size or shape.

- In a liquid, the molecules are packed closely together but still move rapidly and slide over another. Gas, molecules far apart but move at high speed. Solid, held tight together and mostly stay in place (some can wiggle).

## Pure Substances

- A **pure substance** (usually referred to simply as a _substance_) is matter that has distinct properties and a composition that does not vary from sample to sample.
	-  Water and table salt (sodium chloride) are examples of pure substances.

> [!NOTE]
> - [*]  All *substances* are either <font color = #84C1FF> elements </font>  or compounds.
> 
> 	- <font color = #84C1FF >Elements </font> are substances that cannot be decomposed into simpler substances. On the molecular level, each element is composed of only one kind of atom (Figure 1.4(a) and (b) ).
> 	    
> 	- **Compounds** are substances composed of two or more elements; they contain two or more kinds of atoms (Figure 1.4(c))

- **Mixtures** are combinations of two or more substances in which each substance retains its chemical identity.

## Compounds
- Most elements can interact with other elements to form compounds.
	- For example, when hydrogen gas burns in oxygen gas, the elements hydrogen and oxygen combine to form the compound water.

The elements hydrogen and oxygen themselves exist naturally as _diatomic_ (two-atom) molecules:

## Mixture

Most of the matter we encounter consists of mixtures of different substances. Each substance in a mixture retains its chemical identity and properties. In contrast to a pure substance, which by definition has a fixed composition, the composition of a mixture can vary. A cup of sweetened coffee, for example, can contain either a little sugar or a lot. The substances making up a mixture are called _components_ of the mixture.

- **Solution** mixture of substance that has uniform composition; a homogeneous mixture.

## Temperature

- The **Celsius scale** was originally based on the assignment of 0 °C to the freezing point of water and 100 °C to its boiling point at sea level

- The **Kelvin scale** is the SI temperature scale, and the SI unit of temperature is the _kelvin_ (K). Zero on the Kelvin scale is the temperature at which all thermal motion ceases, a temperature referred to as **absolute zero**. On the Celsius scale, absolute zero has the value −273.15 °C.

> [!NOTE]
> $$ K = C + 273.15$$

- The freezing point of water, 0 °C, is 273.15 K

## Derived SI Units

The SI base units are used to formulate _derived units_. A **derived unit** is obtained by multiplication or division of one or more of the base units.


**Density** is defined as the amount of mass in a unit volume of a substance:

$$density = \frac{mass}{volume}$$

## Units of Energy

- The SI unit for energy is the **joule** (pronounced “jool”), J. 
- units of energy are $(mass)×(velocity)^2$
- Because a joule is not a very large amount of energy, we often use _kilojoules_ (kJ) in discussing the energies associated with chemical reactions

A **calorie** (cal) was originally defined as the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 g of water from 14.5 to 15.5 °C. It has since been defined in terms of a joule:

$$1 cal = 4.184 J (exactly)$$
1 Cal=1000 cal=1 kcal.
