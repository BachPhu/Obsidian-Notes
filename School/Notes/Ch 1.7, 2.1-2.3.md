- The _law of constant composition_ (Section 1.2), based on postulate 4:
    In a given compound, the relative numbers and kinds of atoms are constant.

- The **law of conservation of mass,** based on postulate 3:
    The total mass of materials present after a chemical reaction is the same as the total mass present before the reaction.

- The **law of multiple proportions**
     If two elements A and B combine to form more than one compound, the masses of B that can combine with a given mass of A are in the ratio of small whole numbers

# 2.2 The Discovery of Atomic Structure

> [!Objective]
> - 2.2.1 Describe the experiments that led to the discovery of the electron and its charge.
>     
> - 2.2.2 Describe types of radioactivity and their properties.
>     
> - 2.2.3 Describe the nuclear model of the atom and the experiments that led to its discovery.

Atom is composed of **[[subatomic particles]]**: particles such as protons, neutrons, and electrons 

_Particles with the same charge repel one another, whereas particles with opposite charges attract one another_.

## Cathode Rays and Electrons

> [!History]
> During the mid-1800s, scientists began to study electrical discharge through a glass tube pumped almost empty of air

When a high voltage was applied to the electrodes in the tube, radiation was produced between the electrodes. This radiation, called **[[cathode rays]]**, originated at the negatively charged electrode (the **_cathode_**) and traveled to the positively charged electrode (the **_anode_**).
**![[cathode rays]]**
Although the rays could not be seen, their presence was detected because they caused certain materials to _fluoresce_—that is, to give off light.
