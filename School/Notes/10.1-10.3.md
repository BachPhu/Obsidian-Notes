• Composed mainly of nonmetallic elements with simple formulas and low molar masses.  
• Fill any container uniformly  
• Easily compressible  
• Completely mix with other gases  
• Exert pressure on their surroundings  
• Two or more gases form a homogeneous mixture

## Atmospheric pressure  

- Define the property of pressure  
- Define and convert among the units of pressure measurements
- Pressure: $$P = \frac{F}{A}$$
- Atmospheric pressure is measured with a barometer.  
• Manometer, device used for measuring the pressure of a  
gas in a container

## Units for Pressure

- **Pascals:** $1 Pa = 1 N/m^2$ (SI unit of pressure)  
• **Bar**: 1 bar = 105 Pa = 100 kPa  
• **mm Hg** or **torr**: These units are literally the difference in the heights measured in millimeters of a column of mercury, as in the barometer in the figure.  
• **Standard Atmospheric Pressure**: Normal atmospheric pressure at sea level

> ❑ 760. mm  
> ❑ 101.325 kPa  
> ❑ 1.10325 bar


# 10.2 The Gas Laws

- Identify the mathematical relationships between the various properties of gases  
• Use the ideal gas law, and related gas laws, to compute the values of various gas properties under specified conditions

> [!NOTE]
> The physical properties of a gas can be defined by four variables:  
> 1) P pressure  
> 2) T temperature  
> 3) V volume  
> 4) n amount of gas, expressed as number of moles

The equations that define the relationships between these variables are known as the gas laws.


## Boyle’s Law: Relating Pressure and Volume

- The volume of a fixed quantity of gas at constant temperature is inversely proportional to the pressure.

$$P \propto \frac{1}{V}$$
$PV$ = constant
$PV =k$ 

This means, if we compare two conditions:  
$$P_1V_1 = P_2V_2$$

## Charles’s Law: Relating Volume and Temperature

The volume of a fixed amount of gas at constant pressure is directly proportional to its absolute temperature.

𝑉 ∝ 𝑇 (at a constant 𝑃 and n)
$𝑉 / 𝑇$ = constant

### Charles’s Law: Determining Absolute Zero

V = Constant x T
This means, if we compare two conditions:  
$$\frac{V_1}{T_{1}}= \frac{V_2}{T_2}$$

- Plot of volume of a gas (at constant pressure) versus its temperature (in °C) gives a straight line
- Volumes of all the gases extrapolate to zero at the same temperature, – 273° C (0 K - Absolute zero)

## Avogadro’s Law: Gases in Open System

  
- The volume of a gas at constant temperature and pressure is directly proportional  
to the number of moles of the gas.  
• Avogadro postulated that equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and  
pressure contain the same number of particles  
• So, at STP, one mole of ANY gas occupies 22.4 L

𝑉 ∝ n (at a constant 𝑃 and T)
$𝑉 / n$ = constant

$$\frac{V_1}{n_{1}}= \frac{V_2}{n_2}$$

# 10.3 Gas Laws, Ideal Gas Equation and The Combined Gas Law

$V \propto \frac{1}{P}$ (Boyle's Law)
$V \propto T$ (Charles's Law)
$V \propto n$ (Avogadro's Law)

Combining these, we get: 
$$PV = nRT$$

Universal gas constant: 
R = 0.08206 L · atm/K · mol  or 8.314 J/K · mol


- if we compare two conditions:
$$\frac{P_1V_1}{T_{1}}= \frac{P_2V_2}{T_2}$$

In solving problems:  
1. Tabulate the information.  
2. Convert to consistent units.  
3. Pick the correct equation, then solve for the unknown.  
4. Use dimensional analysis

## Ideal Gases and the Ideal Gas Law

The behaviors of an ideal gas follow two assumptions:  
• Volumes of individual gases are insignificant compared to overall volume  
• Particles do not interact with one another

## Standard Conditions

The conditions 0°C and 1 atm are referred as Standard temperature and pressure (STP)

- Molar volume at STP  
- Volume of one mole of gas at STP is 22.4 L using 1 atm for pressure  
- 22.7 L using 1 bar for pressure

## Gas Densities and Molar Mass

The density of any gas at STP can be calculated by dividing its molar mass by molar volume.

$$d = \frac{MP}{RT}$$
  
Derived from Ideal-gas equation:  mol x g/mol = g(m)

---
- One needs to know the molecular mass, the pressure, and the temperature to calculate the density of a gas.

$$d = \frac{MP}{RT}$$

- One needs to know the mass, volume, and temperature of a gas to calculate the molar mass

$$M = \frac{mRT}{PV}$$
