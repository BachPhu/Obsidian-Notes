- new tech -> allow more chances to publish papers, communicate w public -> more availiable content , ppl become cheap-> more dilute content -> harder for both side to find each other
- scientist need greater responsibility and accuracy content but also open for fair opinion
- reader need to be responsible for selecting credibility source to consume
- the opportunity in the internet landscape r broad, for both citizen and scientist discussion

 - bc of the promote definition of science, it built up expectation and eventually ppl discard it when the outcome doesnt fit their bias

- publish in context to 

### Significant passage
Science paper. Question that should amateur scientist be restrict to publicly criticism science matter? Since the internet cooperate into own life, we used forum for discussion. It offer both risks and open room for new/different views. therefore, we need to redefine accuracy and quality while staying open, which can be a struggle for scientist.

### Structure
first half: mention the problems 
second half: state his opinion
