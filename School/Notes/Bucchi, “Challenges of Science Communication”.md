> 1) In your own words, _summarize_ the reading's main claim(s).
> 2) Briefly _summarize_ and _describe_ the type(s) of evidence the author uses to support this claim.
> 3) _Identify_ and _explain_ a particularly significant passage from the reading. Does the passage serve as a key to understanding the reading's larger point? Does it provide a particularly compelling example? Does it prompt further avenues for investigation?
> 4) _Write_ at least two discussion questions about any aspect of the reading.

- new tech -> allow more chances to publish papers, communicate w public -> more availiable content , ppl become cheap-> more dilute content -> harder for both side to find each other
- scientist need greater responsibility and accuracy content but also open for fair opinion
- reader need to be responsible for selecting credibility source to consume

 bc of the promote definition of science, it built up expectation and eventually ppl discard it when the outcome doesnt fit their bias
