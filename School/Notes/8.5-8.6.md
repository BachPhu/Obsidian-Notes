# 8.5 Drawing Lewis Structures of Molecular Compounds and Ions

1. Determine the total number of valence electrons in the molecule or ion.  
- neutral molecule  
- Ions  
	- If it is an anion, add one electron for each negative charge.  
	- If it is a cation, subtract one electron for each positive charge.  

2. Arrange symbols of elements to show how atoms are bonded together and connect them with  single bonds (one electron pair). Keep track of the electrons.  
- central atom- greatest bonding capacity or the least electronegative atom (except H)  

1. Complete the octet of atoms (except hydrogen) bonded to a central atom by adding lone pairs of electrons. Keep track of the electrons.  
2. Compare number of valence electrons in the Lewis structure with the number determined in step 1.  
3. Place any remaining electrons on the central atom.  
4. If there are not enough electrons to give the central atom an octet, rearrange the electrons of  the outer atoms as needed to give multiple bonds(double or triple) to complete the octet.

_Giving Multiple Bonds_: If there are not enough electrons to give the central atom  
an octet, try multiple bonds

---
- For charged ions, enclose the structure in the square parenthesis  
and put the charge on the top  
- For molecules with multiple carbon atoms, bond carbon atoms one  
to the other first and then distribute the remaining atoms.  
- Write the names of the Electron geometry; and Molecular Geometry  
- All atoms must have octet shown (except for H)

# 8.5 Formal Charge: Choosing among Lewis Structures

- Three different resonance structures for nitrous oxide, N2O (known as laughing gas) can be drawn.

- The structure that best represents the actual bonding pattern in a molecule can be determined by calculating the formal charges on each atom.  
- A **formal charge (FC)** is a way to count the electrons formally assigned to an atom in a molecular structure, compared with the number of electrons in the free (i.e.; nonbonded) atom.  
- Definition: The formal charge of any atom in a molecule is the charge the atom would  
have if each bonding electron pair in the molecule were shared equally between its  
two atoms.  
- Formal charges are not real charges

___
## How to Identify the Dominant Lewis Structure  
1) The dominant Lewis structure is generally the one in which the atoms bear formal charges closest to zero.  
2) A Lewis structure in which any negative charges reside on the more electronegative atoms is generally more dominant than one that has negative charges on the less electronegative atoms

# 8.6 Resonance

- The existence of multiple Lewis structures, called _resonance structures_ (or resonance hybrids), for a given bonding arrangement of atoms.  

- **Resonance structure**: one of two or more Lewis structures with same arrangement of atoms but _different arrangement of bonding pairs of electrons_  
- In writing the Resonance structures, the _positions of some electron pairs change but the position of the atoms stay the same_

### Lewis Structure of Ozone  

- Ozone (O3) and molecular oxygen (O2) are _allotropes_, or different molecular forms, of oxygen.  
- Two different Lewis structures of ozone can be drawn.  
- The structures have the same arrangement of atoms, but different arrangements of bonding and lone pairs

# 8.4 Polarity of Bonds and Electronegativity

- The electrons in a covalent bond are not always shared equally.  
- Bond polarity is a measure of how equally or unequally the electrons in a covalent bond are shared.  
- In a nonpolar covalent bond, the electrons are shared equally.  
- In a polar covalent bond, one of the atoms attracts electrons to itself with a greater force.

## Polar or Nonpolar Covalent Bonds (Equal Sharing and Unequal Sharing)

Define electronegativity and assess the polarity of covalent bonds  
- **Pure Covalent bond**: Two identical atoms share electrons equally  
- **Non-polar Covalent Bond**: two different atoms share electrons almost equally  
- **Unequal Sharing and Polar Bonds**: The unequal sharing of electrons between two different atoms gives rise to a polar covalent bond.  
	 - A polar covalent bond acts as a tiny electric dipole


## Electronegativity  
- Bond polarity can be explained using the concept of electronegativity, EN.  
- Electronegativity is relative measure of the ability of an atom to attract electrons to itself within a bond.  
- On the periodic table, electronegativity generally increases as you go:  
- from left to right across a period.  
- from the bottom to the top of a group.
