# Thermochemistry
# Nature of Energy

- __Thermochemistry__ is the study of chemical reactions and the energy changes that  
involve heat.  
- __Energy__ is the ability to do work or transfer heat..  
	 Energy is a quantitative property that must be transferred to an object to perform work
- __Work__ is a force acting over a distance 
$$\text{Energy = work = force} \times \text{distance}$$
- __Heat__ is the flow of energy caused by a difference in temperature.

- You can think of heat and work as the two different ways that an object can exchange energy with other objects.  
	Either out of it or into it

# 5.1 The Nature of Chemical Energy

- Potential Energy (PE): Energy due to position or Composition.  
• The energy that originates from chemical reactions is associated mainly with changes in potential energy  
• Energy is released when chemical bonds are formed $(E_{el} < 0)$ ; energy is consumed $(E_{el} > 0)$when chemical bonds are broken.

$$E_{el} = \frac{kQ_{1}Q_{2}}{d}$$
$$1 \text{ J} = 1\frac{kg m^{2}}{s^{2}}$$

## The nature of Energy and Forms of Energy

- Kinetic Energy (KE): Energy due to the motion of an object, or energy that is being transferred.  
- Thermal energy is the energy associated with temperature.  
- Thermal energy is a form of kinetic energy.  
- Chemical energy: which is dependent upon the way the atoms are bonded together

# 5.2 First Law of Thermodynamics

  
- Energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be converted from  
one form into another.  
- Law of conservation of energy: Energy can be converted from one  
form to another but can be neither created nor destroyed  
	Energy of the universe is constant

## Parts of the Universe: System and Surroundings

- We define the _system_ as the material or process within which we are studying the energy changes within.  
	A chemical reaction represents a system.  

-  The _surroundings_ are everything else (here, the cylinder, piston, and everything beyond) with which the system can exchange energy.  

## Three Types of Thermodynamic Systems  

When discussing a thermodynamic system, we must indicate how it can interact with its surroundings.  
• In an _open system_ heat and mass can flow freely between system and surroundings.  
• In a _closed system_ only, heat can flow between system and surroundings.  
• An _isolated system_ is one that is completely shut off from its surroundings so that neither mass nor mass can be transferred.  

---

## Thermodynamic Quantities Have Three Parts
  
1. A number  
2. A unit  
3. A sign

Note about the sign:  
• A positive ΔE results when the system gains energy from the surroundings.  
• A negative ΔE results when the system loses energy to the surroundings

---

## Internal Energy

The internal energy of a system is the sum of all kinetic and potential energies of all components of the system. Represented by the symbol E.  
We generally don’t know E, only how it changes (ΔE

The internal energy (E): The change in internal energy, ΔE, is the final  
energy of the system minus the initial energy of the system:

$$\Delta E= q + w$$

Internal energy is a state function which depends only on the initial and final states. It does not depend on path.  
• The change in internal energy is independent of how it was acquired

If: $\Delta e < 0, E_{final} < E_{initial}$
the system _released_ energy to the surroundings.

If: $\Delta e > 0, E_{final} > E_{initial}$
the system _absorbed_ energy to the surroundings.

---

## Heat and Work: Methods of Transferring Energy  
- Heat and work are two ways energy moves in between the system and surroundings
$$\Delta E= q + w$$

- Heat: Transfer of energy between two objects due to a temperature difference  
- Work is a force exerted through a distance
$$\omega = F \times d$$

---

## Δ E, Q, W, and Their Signs

- Number - Gives the magnitude of change  
- Sign - Indicates the direction of flow and reflects the system’s point of view unit

|         |                                               |                                               |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| For q | + means system _gains_ heat from surroundings | − means system _loses_ heat to surroundings   |
| For w| + means work done _on_ system by surroundings | − means work done _by_ system on surroundings |
| For ΔE  | + means _net gain_ of energy by system        | − means _net loss_ of energy by system        |

## Exchange of Heat Between System and Surroundings

Reactions are classified as to whether they give off or absorb energy, usually in the form of heat.

### Exothermic Processes  
• Exothermic reaction: Energy flows from a system to its surroundings
If: $\Delta e < 0, E_{final} < E_{initial}$

 Reaction Mechanism  
• Energy gained by the surroundings must be equal to the energy lost by the system. 
- PE stored in chemical bonds is converted to thermal energy via heat.  
- Net result - Quantity of energy Δ(PE) is transferred to the surroundings through heat.

### Endothermic reactions  

Endothermic reaction: Energy flows from the surroundings into a system
If: $\Delta e > 0, E_{final} > E_{initial}$

Reaction Mechanism
- Energy gained by the system must be equal to the energy lost by the surroundings
- Energy that flows into the system as heat is used to increase the PE of the system  
- Products have higher PE than reactants

## State Functions

- Finding the value of internal energy of a system is simply too complex a problem.  
• **State function (state property)**: Property that does not depend in any way on the system’s past or future. It depends only on the present state, or condition, of the system, not on the path used to arrive at that state.  
• And so, ΔE depends only on the $E_{initial}$ and $E_{final}$

Note q and w are not state functions. They are path dependent.  
• Whether the battery is shorted out or is discharged by running the fan, its ΔE is the  
same, but q and w are _different_ in the two cases

## Pressure – Volume Work

Pressure–volume work is done when gases expand or are compressed under external pressure (P).  
• Units: 1 L ⋅ atm = 101.325 J  
$$w = – PΔV$$

For an expanding gas:
- ΔV is a positive quantity  
- w is negative quantity

When a gas is compressed: 
- ΔV is a negative quantity  
-  w a positive quantity

# 5.3 Enthalpy Changes & Calorimetry

• Enthalpy and Enthalpy Changes  
• Heat Capacity, Specific Heat Capacity, & Molar Heat Capacity  
• Enthalpies of Reaction and Calorimetry

## Enthalpy and Enthalpy Changes

Enthalpy (H): Total heat content of the system  

• Since many chemical and physical processes take place under a constant pressure (and we usually work at atmospheric pressure), and the only work done is this pressure–volume work.  

• We use the enthalpy (H) to track the energy and heat flow into or out of a thermodynamic system.  
• Enthalpy is defined as the sum of the internal energy and pressure–volume product of a system,  H = E + PV.  

We can measure the enthalpy change (ΔH) of a chemical reaction or phase  change.  
$$ΔH = ΔE + PΔV \text{ and  } ΔH = q_{P}$$
• Some reactions are exothermic (Δ H < 0) and some are endothermic (Δ H > 0).  
• Like $\Delta E$, $\Delta H$is a state function, so the value depends only upon the difference between the initial and final states, not the pathway followed.  
∆H = $H_{final}$ - $H_{initial}$

# 5.4 Enthalpies of Reaction

The _change_ in enthalpy, ΔH, is the enthalpy of the products minus the enthalpy of  
the reactants:
$$\Delta H)_{rxn} =  H_{products} - H_{reactants}$$
### Heat of Reaction  
This quantity, $ΔH_{rxn}$ is called the _enthalpy of reaction_, or _the heat of reaction_

---

- For phase changes:  
	- Enthalpy of fusion ($\Delta H_{fus}$)  
		- S → L at freezing point  
	- Enthalpy of vaporization ($\Delta H_{vap}$)  
		- L→ Vapor at boiling point  

- For chemical reactions:  
	- Enthalpy of reaction $\Delta H_{rxn}$) or called heat of the reaction  
	- Enthalpy of combustion (ΔH∘C)  

- The enthalpy values are reported per mole of substance converted

# 5.5 Relating Temperature Change and Heat Flow

## Heat Capacity, Specific Heat Capacity, & Molar Heat Capacity  
• The **heat capacity ($C_{P}$)** of a substance is the energy required to raise the temperature of an object by 1°C at constant pressure.  
• Units - J/°C  
$$\text{C = } \frac{\text{heat absorbed}}{\text{increase in temperature}} $$

• **Specific heat ($c_{s}$)** is measured per gram of a substance.  
• Units - J/°C · g or J/K · g  

• **Molar heat capacity ($c_{p}$)** is measured per mole of substance.  
• Units - J/°C · mol or J/K · mol  

• The heat capacity or specific heat is used to relate the temperature change of a substance to the amount of heat (q) absorbed or lost by the substance

$𝑞 = 𝐶_{P}∆𝑇$
$𝑞 = 𝑚𝑐_{s}∆𝑇$  
$𝑞 = 𝑛𝑐_{p}∆𝑇$

---

## Specific Heat and Molar Heat Capacity  
• Both quantities are intensive properties  and depend on the physical state of the  substance.  
• If we know the mass of a substance and its  specific heat, we can determine the amount of  heat, q, entering or leaving the substance by  measuring the temperature change before and  after the heat is gained or lost:  
 
q = (specific heat) × (mass of substance) × (temperature change)  
q = c × m × ΔT  
=c × m × ($T_{final} − T_{initial}$)

## 5.5 Calorimetry

Learning Objectives:  
• Explain the technique of calorimetry  
• Calculate and interpret heat and related properties using typical calorimetry data  

One technique we can use to measure the amount of heat involved in a chemical or physical process is known as calorimetry. Calorimetry is used to measure amounts of heat transferred to or from a substance.  

• **Calorimeter**: Device used experimentally to determine the heat associated with a chemical reaction.  
• Used to determine specific heat of a metal and changes in enthalpy for reactions that occur in solution.  
- **Coffee cup calorimeter**
• Two nested Styrofoam cups  
• Useful for determining ∆Hrxn for reactions in aqueous solution


### Constant - Pressure Calorimetry  

• By carrying out a reaction in aqueous solution in a simple calorimeter, the heat change for the system can be found by measuring the heat change for the water in the calorimeter.  
• We can calculate ΔH for the reaction with this equation:

$$\text{Energy(as heat) released by the reaction = Energy(as heat) absorbed by the reaction}$$

$$q_{soln} = C \times m_{soln} \times \Delta T = -q_{rxn} $$
$$\text{q water = - q reaction}$$

• Heat of a reaction is an extensive property.  
Depends directly on the amount of substance  

---

## Determining the Enthalpies of Reaction -Neutralization Reaction  

q water = - q reaction  
• The standard enthalpy change of neutralization is the enthalpy change when solutions of an acid and an alkali react together under standard conditions to produce 1 mole of water.  
• Notice that enthalpy change of neutralization is always measured _per mole of water formed_.  

# 5.6 Hess’ s Law (Hess’s Law of Constant Heat Summation

Hess’s Law states that: If a process can be written as the sum of several  stepwise processes, the enthalpy change (∆Hrxn) of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes (∆Hrxn) of the various steps

- Hess’s law is valid because enthalpy is  a state function: Enthalpy changes depend only on where a chemical process starts and ends, but not on the path it takes from start to finish

## Manipulating thermochemical equations  
• When a reaction is multiplied by a factor, ∆Hrxn is multiplied by that factor.  
	• Because ∆Hrxn is extensive.  
• If a reaction is reversed, then the sign of ∆H is changed.
