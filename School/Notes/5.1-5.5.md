# Thermochemistry
# Nature of Energy

- __Thermochemistry__ is the study of chemical reactions and the energy changes that  
involve heat.  
- __Energy__ is the ability to do work or transfer heat..  
	 Energy is a quantitative property that must be transferred to an object to perform work
- __Work__ is a force acting over a distance 
$$\text{Energy = work = force} \times \text{distance}$$
- __Heat__ is the flow of energy caused by a difference in temperature.

- You can think of heat and work as the two different ways that an object can exchange energy with other objects.  
	Either out of it or into it

# 5.1 The Nature of Chemical Energy

- Potential Energy (PE): Energy due to position or Composition.  
• The energy that originates from chemical reactions is associated mainly with changes in potential energy  
• Energy is released when chemical bonds are formed $(E_{el} < 0)$ ; energy is consumed $(E_{el} > 0)$when chemical bonds are broken.

$$E_{el} = \frac{kQ_{1}Q_{2}}{d}$$
$$1 \text{ J} = 1\frac{kg m^{2}}{s^{2}}$$

## The nature of Energy and Forms of Energy

- Kinetic Energy (KE): Energy due to the motion of an object, or energy that is being transferred.  
- Thermal energy is the energy associated with temperature.  
- Thermal energy is a form of kinetic energy.  
- Chemical energy: which is dependent upon the way the atoms are bonded together

# 5.2 First Law of Thermodynamics

  
- Energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be converted from  
one form into another.  
- Law of conservation of energy: Energy can be converted from one  
form to another but can be neither created nor destroyed  
	Energy of the universe is constant

## Parts of the Universe: System and Surroundings

- We define the _system_ as the material or process within which we are studying the energy changes within.  
	A chemical reaction represents a system.  

-  The _surroundings_ are everything else (here, the cylinder, piston, and everything beyond) with which the system can exchange energy.  

## Three Types of Thermodynamic Systems  

When discussing a thermodynamic system, we must indicate how it can interact with its surroundings.  
• In an _open system_ heat and mass can flow freely between system and surroundings.  
• In a _closed system_ only, heat can flow between system and surroundings.  
• An _isolated system_ is one that is completely shut off from its surroundings so that neither mass nor mass can be transferred.

## Thermodynamic Quantities Have Three Parts
  
1. A number  
2. A unit  
3. A sign

Note about the sign:  
• A positive ΔE results when the system gains energy from the surroundings.  
• A negative ΔE results when the system loses energy to the surroundings

## Internal Energy

The internal energy of a system is the sum of all kinetic and potential energies of all components of the system. Represented by the symbol E.  
We generally don’t know E, only how it changes (ΔE

The internal energy (E): The change in internal energy, ΔE, is the final  
energy of the system minus the initial energy of the system:

$$\Delta E= q + w$$

Internal energy is a state function which depends only on the initial and final states. It does not depend on path.  
• The change in internal energy is independent of how it was acquired

If: $\Delta e < 0, E_{final} < E_{initial}$
the system _released_ energy to the surroundings.

If: $\Delta e > 0, E_{final} > E_{initial}$
the system _absorbed_ energy to the surroundings.

## Heat and Work: Methods of Transferring Energy  
- Heat and work are two ways energy moves in between the system and surroundings
$$\Delta E= q + w$$

- Heat: Transfer of energy between two objects due to a temperature difference  
- Work is a force exerted through a distance
$$\omega = F \times d$$
## Δ E, Q, W, and Their Signs

- Number - Gives the magnitude of change  
- Sign - Indicates the direction of flow and reflects the system’s point of view unit

### $q$ Heat
q = + value
