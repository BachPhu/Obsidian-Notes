# Thermochemistry
# Nature of Energy

- __Thermochemistry__ is the study of chemical reactions and the energy changes that  
involve heat.  
- __Energy__ is the ability to do work or transfer heat..  
	 Energy is a quantitative property that must be transferred to an object to perform work
- __Work__ is a force acting over a distance 
$$\text{Energy = work = force} \times \text{distance}$$
- __Heat__ is the flow of energy caused by a difference in temperature.

- You can think of heat and work as the two different ways that an object can exchange energy with other objects.  
	Either out of it or into it  

# 5.1 The Nature of Chemical Energy

- Potential Energy (PE): Energy due to position  
or Composition.  
• The energy that originates from chemical  
reactions is associated mainly with changes in  
potential energy  
• Energy is released when chemical bonds are  
formed $(E_{el} < 0)$ ; energy is consumed $(E_{el} > 0)$when chemical bonds are broken.
