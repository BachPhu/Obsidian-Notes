# 8.7 Exceptions to the Octet Rule  

- There are three types of ions or molecules that do not follow the octet rule:  
a) Ions or molecules with an odd number of electrons  
b) Ions or molecules with less than an octet 
	- Be, B, and Al form electron-deficient molecules.  
c) Ions or molecules with more than eight valence electrons (an _expanded octet_-element is in periods 3 through 6)

Expanded Octets:  
- Some atoms can accommodate more than an octet of  valence electrons.  
- Atoms of nonmetals in the third row and below can have an expanded octet. They have d-orbitals that they can use for bonding.
