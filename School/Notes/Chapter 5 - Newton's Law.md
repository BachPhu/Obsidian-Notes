# 5.1 Forces

**Kinematics**: The study of motion is called kinematics, but kinematics only describes the way objects move—their velocity and their acceleration.
**Dynamics** is the study of how forces affect the motion of objects and systems. It considers the causes of motion of objects and systems of interest, where a system is anything being analyzed.

We can define **force** as the push or pull on an object with a specific magnitude and direction (therefore, it is a vector quantity)

The SI unit of force is called the newton (abbreviated N)
$$\text{1 N = 1 kg} \cdot m / s^{2}$$

## Contact forces

Contact forces also result from fundamental interaction and occur when there is direct contact between two objects:
- the *normal force* is the force that a surface of an object will push back with,
- the *force of tension* redirects an applied force to another position,
- the *spring force* will pull a spring back toward an equilibrium position, 
- the frictional force is a force that opposes motion.

The spring force follows Hooke’s law, which states
$$F_{x}= -k(x - x_{0})$$
where $x_{0}$ is the equilibrium length

## 5.2 Newton’s First Law

_Newton’s First Law_ states that the velocity of an object will remain unchanged unless it is acted on by a net external force.
 $$\vec{v} \text{ = constant when  } \vec{F}_{net} = \text{0 N}$$

## 5.3 Newton's Second Law
_Newton’s Second Law_ states that the sum of all forces acting on an object is equal to the mass times acceleration of that object

The acceleration of a system is directly proportional to and in the same direction as the net external force acting on the system and is inversely proportion to its mass.
$$F_{net}= F = ma$$
## Newton’s Second Law and Momentum

The instantaneous rate at which a body’s momentum changes is equal to the net force acting on the body.
$$m\vec{a} = \vec{F}_{net} = d\vec{p}/dt$$
$$\vec{p} = m\vec{v}$$

# 5.4 Mass and Weight
## Weight and Gravitational Force

The gravitational force on a mass is its weight. We can write this in vector form, where $\vec{w}$ weight and m is mass, as
$$\vec{W} = m\vec{g}$$

# 5.5 Newton’s third law
- Newton’s third law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
- These each force will appear on one of the two objects and will point in opposite directions.
- Mathematically, if a body A exerts a force $\vec{F}$ on body B, then B simultaneously exerts a force $-\vec{F}$ on A, or in vector equation form
$$\vec{F}_{AB}= -\vec{F}_{AB}  $$

## Distinguishing force pairs
We have seen that Newton’s third law will give us a pair of equal an opposite forces. $\vec{F}_{AB}= -\vec{F}_{AB}$ 
- Both forces act on a different object.
- Both forces result from the same interaction.

This is what is taking place internally between two objects A and B.
There are also times where an external contact interaction is a force pair.

External contact pairs can be called a Newton’s second law pair, and these don’t have to be equal in magnitude, but they will be if the object isn’t accelerating.

The requirements for a Newton’s second law pair are:
- Both forces must act on the same object.
- Both forces are equal and opposite in a particular direction.
- There are no other forces in this direction, so the acceleration in this direction is zero.

# 5.6 Common Forces
## Normal Force

This pushing force is directed perpendicular to the surface, and thus is called the normal force. ($\vec{F}_{N}$ or $\vec{N}$)

## Tension
A *tension* is a force along the length of a medium; in particular, it is a pulling force that acts along a stretched flexible connector, such as a rope or cable. ($\vec{F}_T$ or $\vec{T}$ )

Tension is constant throughout a rope that is in equilibrium.

## Ideal Strings and Pulleys

Ropes and strings are ideal if:
- they are massless,
- they don’t stretch,
- they are flexible, i.e., they connect directly between the two points that they are attached to.

In reality, ropes and strings won’t have exactly these properties.

A pulley is ideal if:
- it is massless and small,
- it has no friction in its bearings.

Strings allow a force placed at one position to be transferred to another position.

Pulleys allow for a force in one direction to be re-directed in another direction.
