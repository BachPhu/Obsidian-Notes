- Context: Lags behind Europe and Asia in scientific and mathematic field 
- The need to inspire/motivate the public to seek for more knowledge

### Claim
- Report from National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2016) underline the challenges scientists faced while communicate with the public
- The report has a strong foundation for the science communication topic and would be more fitted for students who are interest in the topic. But the report was lack of information on ways to improve the problem. Also offered outdated info
---

- the report states, “A strategy of repeated exposure to a message delivered in multiple formats by diverse actors via various platforms is effective for conveying a message of consensus to many segments of the public.” The model is assuming that the pubic misunderstand the info which then cause flaws to this approach
- But it turn out that provide the public more information alone does not close the gap bt public and scientist. Bc it was not caused by lack of info
- Science-related controversies can arise from different beliefs (ex: religion), values and concerns (skeptical, safety or potential danger). Or when some thing was present to public by various research interest, which cause confusion.
- "report author focused on modifying the message being broadcast rather than improving the interface between science and the public"
- [[upstream engagement]]. the article's author discussed that the report author didn't consider this method even though it show positive result

---
### Media
- the report did good in naming the challenges that scientists face with modern media
- report say the social media is something science community have to cope with while the article author believe the otherwise.
- report doubt journalist while article say they should trust journalist since they are the communicator for the scientists
