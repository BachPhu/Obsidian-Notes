**Continuous spectrum**: Results when white light is passed through a prism  
‚ñ™ Contains all the wavelengths of visible light

**Line spectrum**: Shows only certain discrete wavelengths  
‚ñ™ Each element has a unique line spectrum.

## The Hydrogen Spectrum

- Johann Balmer (1885) discovered a simple formula relating the four emission lines to integers.  
- Johannes Rydberg advanced this formula.  
($R_{H}$ is called the Rydberg constant.)  
- Neils Bohr explained why this mathematical relationship works.  

$$\frac{1}{\lambda} = R_{H}(\frac{1}{n^{2}_{1}}-\frac{1}{n^2_{2}})$$
$$ùëÖ_{H} = 1.0974 √ó 10^{7}m^{‚àí1} = 1.0974 √ó 10^{‚àí2}nm^{‚àí1}$$

## Bohr‚Äôs Hydrogen Atom

Niels Bohr(1885‚Äì1962) - using Planck‚Äôs  
assumption:  
1) Only orbits of certain radii, with specific energies are allowed for the electron in a hydrogen atom .  
- that means the energy ($E_n$) was _quantized_.  
2) **Quantum model**: The electron in a  hydrogen atom moves around the nucleus only in the ‚Äúallowed‚Äù energy  level (energy state).  
3) These orbits are at a fixed distance from the nucleus- stationary states
4) An electron in an allowed energy state does not radiate energy, and, therefore, does not spiral into the nucleus.  
5) Energy is emitted or absorbed by the electron only as the electron changes from one energy state to another. This energy is emitted or absorbed as a photon that has energy,  $E=hv$
6) Electrons in the lowest energy state are in the _ground state, n = 1_. Any energy higher is called an _excited state, n > 1_ 
- Since each orbit has a specific value compared to RH, transitions from one energy level to another can be calculated:
$$\Delta E = E_{f} - E{i} = (-2.18 \times 10^{-18}J)(\frac{1}{n^{2}_{1}}-\frac{1}{n^2_{2}})$$

$$\Delta E = h\frac{c}{\lambda } $$
or 
$$\lambda = \frac{hc}{\Delta E}$$

---

## Energy State Values

- A positive ŒîE means energy is absorbed. A photon is absorbed in this instance.  $n_{f}>n_{i}$

- A negative ŒîE means energy is released. A photon is emitted in this instance.  $n_{f}<n_{i}$
---

## Bohr‚Äôs Model - Conclusions

- Correctly fits the quantized energy levels of the hydrogen atom  
- Postulates only certain allowed circular orbits for the electron  
- Energy is involved in the transition of an electron from one level to another

Draw Backs:

This model only works for hydrogen (one electron).  
‚ñ™ It does not account for electron‚Äìelectron interactions in atoms with more than  
one electron.  
‚ñ™ Electrons have wave-like properties that must be accommodated.

# 6.4 The Wave Behavior of Matter: Dual Nature of Light

Electromagnetic radiation exhibits wave and particulate properties  
Louis de Broglie equation:

$$\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}$$

> [!NOTE]
> Unit: 
> h = $6.626√ó10^{‚Äì34}$ J ¬∑ s  
> Since 1 J = 1 kg ¬∑ $m^2/s^2$  
> h = $6.626√ó10^{‚Äì34}$ kg ¬∑ $m^2$/s

## Diffraction

- Bending of wave around the corner of an obstacle
- Scattered radiation produces a _diffraction pattern_ of bright spots and dark areas on a photographic plate  
	 Diffraction pattern can be explained only in terms of waves

## Heisenberg‚Äôs Uncertainty Principle

- Heisenberg proposed the dual nature of matter (particle and wave) placed a limitation on how precisely we can know both momentum and position.  
- Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that one cannot simultaneously know the exact position and the exact momentum of an electron.  
- The wave and particle nature of the electron are _complementary properties_.  
- The more precisely the momentum of a particle is known, the less precisely its position is known
$$(\Delta x) (\Delta mv) \ge \frac{h}{4 \pi}$$

# 6.5 The Quantum mechanical Model of atom

## Wave Mechanics in Hydrogen
- Erwin Schr√∂dinger developed a mathematical treatment into which both the wave and particle  nature of matter could be  incorporated.  
- This is known as **quantum mechanics**

## Quantum Mechanics and Atomic Orbitals

- The solution of Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs wave equation for hydrogen yields _wave functions_ (œà) for the electron.  
-  The square of the wave function ($œà^2$) gives the _electron density_ or _probability density_ of where an electron is likely to be at any given  time an is called ‚Äò_orbital_‚Äô.  
	electron‚Äôs location when it is in an allowed energy state.  

- Orbitals are three-dimensional regions of space with distinctive shapes, orientations, and average distances from the nucleus.

### Orbitals and Quantum Numbers

> [!NOTE]
> ‚ñ™ Each different atomic orbital is characterized by a set of numbers called _quantum numbers_.  

‚ñ™ It is a unique combination of three integers.

> [!NOTE]
> - These numbers define the size, shape, and orientation of orbitals and the allowed energies of electrons.  
> 	- Magnetic quantum number ($m_l$)
> 	- Principal quantum number (n)  
> 	- Angular momentum quantum number (l)  

---

#### Principal Quantum Number (n)

- The principal quantum number, n, describes the size and energy of an orbital or a group of orbitals in an atom  
- As n increases, the orbitals become larger, and the electron spends more time farther away from the nucleus.  
 - As n increases the electron also has a higher energy and is less tightly bound to the nucleus.

---

#### Angular Momentum Quantum Number (l)

- l (_subshell_): Has integral values from 0 to (n ‚Äì 1) for each value of n  
‚ñ™ Defines the shape of atomic orbitals  
‚ñ™ Value of l for each orbital is assigned a letter : s, p, d, f, ...  
‚ñ™ Each set of orbitals is designated by giving the value of n and the letter for l  
‚ñ™ Orbitals with the same value of n and l are in the same subshell and have the same energy.

#### Magnetic Quantum Number ($m_{l}$)

Defines the orientation of an orbital in space relative to the other orbitals in the atom  
‚ñ™ Has integral values between -l and +l Includes zero  $-l \le m_{l} \le l$ 
‚ñ™ Gives the number of orbitals in each subshell and in turn in each energy level

> [!NOTE]
> s subshell: If l = 0 then $m_{l}$ will be 0
> p subshell : If l=1 then $m_l$ will be ‚àí1, 0, +1
> d subshell : If l = 2 then $m_l$ = ‚àí2, ‚àí 1, 0, +1, +2
> f subshell : If l = 3 then $m_l$ = -3, ‚àí2, ‚àí 1, 0, +1, +2, +3

# 6.6 Orbital Shapes and Energies

## Hydrogen Atom Orbital Energies

- For a _one-electron_ hydrogen atom, orbitals on the same energy level have the same energy.  
- Chemists call them _degenerate_ orbitals.  


---

# 6.7 Many-Electron Atoms

- As the number of electrons increases, so does the repulsion between them.  
‚Ä¢ Therefore, in atoms with more than one electron, not all orbitals on the same energy level are degenerate.  
‚Ä¢ Orbital sets in the same sub-level are still  degenerate.  
‚Ä¢ Energy levels start to overlap in energy (e.g., 4s is lower in energy than 3d)

## Spin Quantum Number, $m_{s}$

- In the 1920s, it was discovered that two electrons in the same orbital do not have exactly the same energy.  
- The ‚Äúspin‚Äù of an electron describes its magnetic field, which affects its energy.  
- This led to the spin quantum number,  $m_s$
- The spin quantum number has only two allowed values, $+\frac{1}{2}$ and $-\frac{1}{2}$ 

## Pauli Exclusion Principle
- No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of four quantum  
numbers.  
- Therefore, no two electrons in the same atom can have the exact same energy.  
- This means that every electron in an atom must differ by at least one of the four  
quantum number values: n, l, $m_{l}$, $m_{s}$ 

---

# 6.8 Electron Configurations

- The way electrons are distributed in an atom is called its _electron configuration_.  
- The most stable organization is the lowest possible energy, called the _ground state_.  

Ex: $4p^{5}$
- Each component consists of  
‚Äì a _number_ denoting the _energy level_, here n = 4:  
‚Äì a _letter_ denoting the type of _orbital_;  
‚Äì a _superscript_ denoting the _number of electrons_ in those orbitals, here there are 5p electrons:

## Electron Configurations and Rules

### Aufbau Principle

Ground state of an atom or ion, electrons fill atomic orbitals of the lowest  
available energy levels before occupying higher levels

![[Pasted image 20231115204643.png | 400]]

---

### Hund‚Äôs Rule  
‚ÄúWhen filling degenerate orbitals the lowest energy is attained when the number of  
electrons having the same spin is maximized.

![[Screen Shot 2023-11-15 at 8.47.58 PM.png]]

- This means that, for a set of orbitals in the same sublevel, there must be one electron in  
each orbital before pairing and the electrons have the same spin, as much as possible

---

## Orbital Diagrams

- Each box in the diagram represents one orbital.  
- Half-arrows represent the electrons.  
- The direction of the arrow represents the relative spin of the electron

---

### Condensed Electron Configurations

- Elements in the same group of the periodic table have the same number of electrons in the outer most shell. These are the _valence electrons_.
- The filled inner shell electrons are called core electrons. They are noble gases. Always include completely filled d or f sublevels
- We write a shortened version of an electron configuration using brackets around the core (noble gas symbol) and listing only valence electrons.

![[Screen Shot 2023-11-15 at 9.03.56 PM.png| 500]]

---

### Lanthanides and Actinides  

- The elements which fill the f orbitals have special names as a portion of a period, not as a group.
- The _lanthanide elements_ (atomic numbers 57 to 70) have electrons entering the 4f sublevel.  
-  The _actinide elements_ (including Uranium, at. no. 92, and Plutonium, at. no. 94) have electrons entering the 5f sublevel.
