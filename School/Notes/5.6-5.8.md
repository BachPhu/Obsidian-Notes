# 5.6 Hess’ s Law (Hess’s Law of Constant Heat Summation

Hess’s Law states that: If a process can be written as the sum of several  stepwise processes, the enthalpy change (∆Hrxn) of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes (∆Hrxn) of the various steps

- Hess’s law is valid because enthalpy is  a state function: Enthalpy changes depend only on where a chemical process starts and ends, but not on the path it takes from start to finish

## Manipulating thermochemical equations  
• When a reaction is multiplied by a factor, ∆Hrxn is multiplied by that factor.  
	• Because ∆Hrxn is extensive.  
• If a reaction is reversed, then the sign of ∆H is changed.  

# 5.7 Standard Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)

A standard enthalpy of formation ΔHf∘ is an enthalpy change for a  
reaction in which exactly 1 mole of a pure substance is formed from its  
elements in their most stable states under standard state (reference  
state) conditions.  
- The coefficient of the compound must be one


The standard state of a substance is its most stable physical state under standard  
conditions (P = 1 atm and T = 25°C).  
- Oxygen = gas  
-  Water = liquid  
-  Carbon = solid (graphite)  
- For a substance in solution, the standard state is a concentration of exactly 1 M  
-  ΔHf° for an element in its standard state is zero

## Standard Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°) and Enthalpy Calculations

Change in enthalpy for a given reaction can be calculated from the enthalpies of  
formation of the reactants and products:

Elements in their standard states are not included in the $ΔH_{reaction}$ calculations  
as ΔHf°for an element in its standard state is zero

# 5.8 Bond Enthalpies

The enthalpy associated with breaking one mole of a particular bond in a gaseous  
substance

- The bond enthalpy is always positive because energy is required to break  
chemical bonds.  
- The greater the bond enthalpy, the stronger the bond.  
- Energy is always released when a bond forms between gaseous fragment.

## Bond Enthalpies and Enthalpies of Reaction

We can predict whether a chemical reaction will be endothermic or exothermic using bond energies

- Add bond energy values for all bonds made  (+)  
- Subtract bond energy values for all bonds broken (-)  
- The result is an estimate of ΔH
