# 5.6 Hess’ s Law (Hess’s Law of Constant Heat Summation

Hess’s Law states that: If a process can be written as the sum of several  stepwise processes, the enthalpy change (∆Hrxn) of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes (∆Hrxn) of the various steps

- Hess’s law is valid because enthalpy is  a state function: Enthalpy changes depend only on where a chemical process starts and ends, but not on the path it takes from start to finish

## Manipulating thermochemical equations  
• When a reaction is multiplied by a factor, ∆Hrxn is multiplied by that factor.  
	• Because ∆Hrxn is extensive.  
• If a reaction is reversed, then the sign of ∆H is changed.  

# 5.7 Standard Enthalpy of Formation (ΔHf°)

A standard enthalpy of formation ΔHf∘ is an enthalpy change for a  
reaction in which exactly 1 mole of a pure substance is formed from its  
elements in their most stable states under standard state (reference  
state) conditions.  
- The coefficient of the compound must be one


The standard state of a substance is its most stable physical state under standard  
conditions (P = 1 atm and T = 25°C).  
- Oxygen = gas  
-  Water = liquid  
-  Carbon = solid (graphite)  
- For a substance in solution, the standard state is a concentration of exactly 1 M  
-  ΔHf° for an element in its standard state is zero
