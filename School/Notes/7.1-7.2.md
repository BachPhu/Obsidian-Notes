# Electron Configuration of Ions: Main Group Elements


To write the electron configuration of ions, begin with the electron configuration of the parent element. If the ion has a positive charge, the appropriate number of electrons is removed from orbital(s) of highest principal quantum number. If the ion has a negative charge, add the appropriate number of electrons to one or more partially filled outer-shell orbitals.  


- The s block elements form monoatomic ions by losing all their outer-shell electrons, leaving their ions with  the electron configuration of the noble gas immediately preceding them in the periodic table.  
- An element of the p block that forms a monoatomic anion does so by gaining enough electrons to completely fill its valence-shell p orbitals. The ion formed has the electron configuration of the noble gas at the end of the row.  
- When ions/atoms have the _same electron configuration_ (as Na+ and F– do), they are __isoelectronic__


# 7.1 Development of the Periodic Table


Periodic Law allows us to predict what  
Quantum Mechanics is a theory that explains why

**Periodic Law** – Properties of elements are periodic function to their atomic masses

### Atomic Number  
Henry Moseley developed the concept of atomic number.  
- Physical and Chemical properties of elements are periodic function to increasing order their atomic numbers  
### Periodicity 
Periodicity is the repetitive pattern of a property for elements based on atomic number.  
The following properties are discussed in this chapter:  
• Sizes of atoms and ions  
• Ionization energy  
• Electron affinity  
• A fundamental property that led to many of the trends is _effective nuclear charge_.

# 7.2 Effective Nuclear Charge

Many atomic properties depend on attractions between valence electrons and  
the nucleus.  
- Electrons are both attracted to the nucleus and repelled by other electrons.  
- The forces an electron experiences depend on both factors.  
- The nuclear charge is screened

The screen or effective nuclear charge

$$Z_{eff}= Z - S$$

where Z is the atomic number and S is a screening constant. S is usually the number of core electrons.  
- Effective nuclear charge is a periodic property:  
- _Increases left to right across a period._
