# General Properties of Aqueous Solutions

Solutions in which water is the dissolving medium are called **aqueous solutions**. The component of the solution that is present in the greatest quantity is the **solvent**. The other components are **solutes**

Any substance whose aqueous solution contains ions is called an **electrolyte**. Any substance that forms a solution containing no ions is a **nonelectrolyte**

Ionic compounds dissociate into ions when they dissolve, so they are **strong electrolytes**.

The solubility of ionic substances is made possible by **solvation**, the interaction of ions with polar solvent molecules.

When representing the ionization of a weak electrolyte in solution, half-arrows in both directions are used, indicating that the forward and reverse reactions can achieve a chemical balance called a **chemical equilibrium**.

# Precipitation Reactions

**Precipitation reactions** are those in which an insoluble product, called a **precipitate**, forms.

(The **solubility** of a substance is the amount that dissolves in a given quantity of solvent.)

Reactions such as precipitation reactions, in which cations and anions appear to exchange partners, are called **exchange reactions**, or **metathesis reactions**.

When the complete chemical formulas of all reactants and products are used, the equation is called a **molecular equation**. A **complete ionic equation** shows all dissolved strong electrolytes as their component ions. In a **net ionic equation**, those ions that go through the reaction unchanged (**spectator ions**) are omitted.

# Acids, Bases, and Neutralization Reactions

Acids and bases are important electrolytes. **Acids** are proton donors; they increase the concentration of $H^+(aq)$ in aqueous solutions to which they are added.

**Bases** are proton acceptors; they increase the concentration of OH−(��) in aqueous solutions. 

Those acids and bases that are strong electrolytes are called **strong acids** and **strong bases**. Those that are weak electrolytes are **weak acids** and **weak bases**.

When solutions of acids and bases are mixed, a neutralization reaction occurs. The **neutralization reaction** between an acid and a metal hydroxide produces water and a **salt**. Gases can also be formed as a result of neutralization reactions.

# Oxidation–Reduction Reactions

**Oxidation** is the loss of electrons by a substance, whereas **reduction** is the gain of electrons by a substance. **Oxidation numbers** (or **oxidation states**) keep track of electrons during chemical reactions and are assigned to atoms using specific rules.

Oxidation is always accompanied by reduction, giving **oxidation–reduction**, or **redox, reactions**.

The redox reactions between metals and acids as well as those between metals and salts are called **displacement reactions**. The products of these displacement reactions are always an element (H2 or a metal) and a salt

A list of metals arranged in order of decreasing ease of oxidation is called an **activity series**. Any metal on the list can be oxidized by ions of metals (or H+) below it in the series.
# Concentrations of Solutions

The **concentration** of a solution expresses the amount of a solute dissolved in the solution. One of the common ways to express the concentration of a solute is in terms of molarity. The **molarity** of a solution is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution

Solutions of known molarity can be formed either by weighing out the solute and diluting it to a known volume or by the **dilution** of a more concentrated solution of known concentration (a stock solution). Adding solvent to the solution (the process of dilution) decreases the concentration of the solute without changing the number of moles of solute in the solution $(M_{conc}×V_{conc}=M_{dil}×V_{dil})$ 

# Solution Stoichiometry and Chemical Analysis

In the common laboratory technique called **titration**, we combine a solution of known concentration (a **standard solution**) with a solution of unknown concentration to determine the unknown concentration or the quantity of solute in the unknown. The point in the titration at which stoichiometrically equivalent quantities of reactants are brought together is called the **equivalence point**. An indicator can be used to show the end point of the titration, which coincides closely with the equivalence point.
