- **4.1** **General Properties of Aqueous Solutions** Recognize that substances dissolved in water exist as ions, molecules, or a mixture of the two.
    
- **4.2** **Precipitation Reactions** Identify reactions in which soluble reactants yield an insoluble product.
    
- **4.3** **Acids, Bases, and Neutralization Reactions** Explore reactions in which protons, H+ ions, are transferred from one reactant to another.
    
- **4.4** **Oxidation–Reduction Reactions** Examine reactions in which electrons are transferred from one reactant to another.
    
- **4.5** **Concentrations of Solutions** Learn to express the amount of a compound dissolved in a given volume of a solution as a _concentration_ in the unit called _molarity_: moles of compound per liter of solution.
    
- **4.6** **Solution Stoichiometry and Chemical Analysis** Use the concepts of stoichiometry and concentration to calculate quantities involved in the laboratory technique known as titration.
