- [n] Notation: $I$ interval, $c$ belongs to the interval 
$$c \in I$$
"$c$ is an element of the set $I$" or "$c$ is in $I$"

- [*] Definition 1) Let f be a function defined over an interval I, and let $c \in I$
- [3] $f$ has an absolute max on $I$ if:
$$f(c) ≥ f(x) \text{ for all x }\in I $$
- [2] $f$ has an absolute min on $I$ if:
$$f(c) ≤ f(x) \text{ for all x }\in I $$

> [!Caution]
> - absolute extremum occurs at x = c → _x-value_
> - absolute extremum is ___ f(c) → _y-value_

# Extreme Value Theorem



# Local Extrema & Critical Points

Let c be an _interior point_(point that is not include the interval end) in the domain f. We say that c is a critical number of f if
$$f'(c) = 0 \text{ or  } f'(c) \text{ is undefined}$$

## Fermat's Theorem
If f has a local extremum at c, and f is differential at c, then 
$$f'(c)= 0$$
## Locating Absolute Extrema

Let f be a continuios function on a closed, bounded interval $[a , b] = I$. The absolute max and absolute min of f over I must occur at either:
1) Endpoints of I
2) Critical points of f
