# 6.1 Solving Problems with Newton’s Laws

PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

1. Sketch the situation, using arrows to represent all forces.
2. Determine the system of interest. The result is a free-body diagram that is essential to solving the problem.(It can sometimes be helpful to draw a dashed box around a system of interest helping to distinguish it and allow for the interactions across the system boundaries to be determined)
3. Apply Newton’s second law to solve the problem.
4. Check the solution to see whether it is reasonable.

# 6.2 Friction

- When a body is in motion, it has resistance because the body interacts with its surroundings. This resistance is a force of friction.
- Friction is a force that opposes relative motion or tendency to move between two surfaces in contact.
- If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another, then the friction between them is called *kinetic friction*. For example, friction slows a hockey puck sliding on ice.
- When objects are stationary relative to one another, *static friction* can act between them; the static friction is usually greater than the kinetic friction between two objects.


Static friction is the friction that will occur for a stationary object:
$$|\vec{F}_{s}\le \mu_{k}|\vec{F}_{n}|$$
