# 6.1 Solving Problems with Newton’s Laws

PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGY

1. Sketch the situation, using arrows to represent all forces.
2. Determine the system of interest. The result is a free-body diagram that is essential to solving the problem.(It can sometimes be helpful to draw a dashed box around a system of interest helping to distinguish it and allow for the interactions across the system boundaries to be determined)
3. Apply Newton’s second law to solve the problem.
4. Check the solution to see whether it is reasonable.

# 6.2 Friction

- When a body is in motion, it has resistance because the body interacts with its surroundings. This resistance is a force of friction.
- Friction is a force that opposes relative motion or tendency to move between two surfaces in contact.
- If two systems are in contact and moving relative to one another, then the friction between them is called *kinetic friction*. For example, friction slows a hockey puck sliding on ice.
- When objects are stationary relative to one another, *static friction* can act between them; the static friction is usually greater than the kinetic friction between two objects.


Static friction is the friction that will occur for a stationary object:
$$|\vec{F}_{s}\le \mu_{s}|\vec{F}_{n}|$$

- [9] Static friction will act to oppose all applied forces up to:
$$|\vec{F}_{\text{s max}} = \mu_{s}|\vec{F}_{n}|$$
- [9] Kinetic friction points opposite of the direction of velocity:
$$|\vec{F}_{\text{k max}} = \mu_{k}|\vec{F}_{n}|$$
In general, these depend on the normal force on the object and on surfaces in contact which determine the coefficients of friction.

# 6.3 Centripetal Force
An object undergoing circular motion must be accelerating because it is changing the direction of its velocity. We proved that this centrally directed acceleration, called centripetal acceleration, is given by the formula

$$a_{c}= \frac{v^{2}}{r} = r\omega^{2}$$
ω : Angular velocity gives the rate at which the object is turning through the curve, in units of rad/s

An acceleration must be produced by a force. Any force or combination of forces can cause a centripetal or radial acceleration.

Any net force causing uniform circular motion is called a centripetal force.

$$F_{c}= ma_{c}=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}=mr\omega^{2}$$
## Banked roads

- Typically, on a level road a car’s ability to turn toward the center of a circle relies on static friction.
- However, if the road is banked a component form the normal force can also help generate the needed inward component, independent of the materials in contact.
- In cases with banked roads, it is best to not rotate the axes as we did with inclines, so that the centripetal acceleration is in the ±x direction.

For*ideal banking*, the net external force equals the horizontal centripetal force in the absence of friction.
A large θ is obtained for a large v and a small r. That is, roads must be steeply banked for high speeds and sharp curves.
