# 10.4 Gas Mixtures and Partial Pressures ‚Äì Dalton‚Äôs Law


‚Ä¢ If two gases that don‚Äôt react are combined in a container, they act as if they are alone in the container.  
‚Ä¢ Dalton‚Äôs Law of Partial Pressures: the total pressure $ùëÉ_{total}$ of a mixture of gases equals the sum of the pressures that each gas $P_{i}$ would exert if it were present alone

Expression for Dalton‚Äôs law of partial pressures

$$ P_{total} = P_1 + P_2+ P_{3}+ ...$$

- Therefore, Total pressure exerted by a mixture of gases is the sum of the pressures of the individual gases  
‚Ä¢ Identities of the gas particles do not matter

If $P_{t} = n_{1}\frac{RT}{V} + n_{2}\frac{RT}{V} + n_{3}\frac{RT}{V}$ then $$P_{t}=n_{t}\frac{RT}{V}$$
## Mole Fractions and Partial Pressure  
‚Ä¢ The ratio of the number of moles of a particular component i in the mixture to the total number of moles in the mixture.  
‚Ä¢ Define mole fraction, $\chi$ 

$$\chi_{1} = \frac{\text{moles of compound 1}}{\text{total moles}} = \frac{n_1}{n_{t}}$$
$\chi_{1} = \frac{n_i}{n_{total}}$

The partial pressure that a gas in a mixture exerts is proportional to its mole fraction:
$$$$
$$P_i = \chi_{i}P_{total}$$


## Collecting Gaseous Products

Water displacement can be used to  collect and measure the volume of  any gas that does not dissolve in  water:  
 $$P_{total} = P_{atm} = P_{O_2} + P_{H_{2}O}$$
