# Electronic Structure
Electronic structure—the arrangement and energy of electrons.  
• It may seem odd to start by talking about waves. However, extremely small particles have properties that can only be explained in this manner.  
• The discoveries of Planck, Einstein, de Broglie, and Heisenberg, showed that matter and energy share common wave-like and particle-like properties  
• These discoveries led to the development of a new field of physics called quantum mechanics

> - 6.1.1 Identify the different types of electromagnetic radiation and arrange them in order of their relative wavelength or frequency.  
> - 6.1.2 Use appropriate equations to calculate related light-wave properties such as frequency, and wavelength

Electromagnetic Radiation

- To understand the electronic structure of atoms, one must understand  
the nature of _electromagnetic radiation_.  
▪ **Electromagnetic radiation** moves as waves through space at the speed of light.  
▪ The distance between corresponding points on adjacent waves is the  
wavelength( $\lambda$ ).

Wavelength (λ): 
Frequency (ν):  
speed (velocity, c):

Wavelength and frequency are inversely related

$$\lambda \propto \frac{1}{v}$$
$$\lambda v = c$$
$$v= \frac{c}{v}$$

**Wavenumber**: Number of wavelength per unit length
$$\overline {v} = \frac{1}{\text{wave length}}$$

**Amplitude**: Defined as height of wave i.e., crest or trough

Electromagnetic spectrum is a continuous range of radiant energy that includes gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet radiation, visible light, infrared radiation, and radio waves.

- All electromagnetic radiation travels at the same velocity:

- [n] The speed of light, c, is $2.9979×10^{8}$ m/s
