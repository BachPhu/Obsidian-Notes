For example, if you were to get an assignment asking you to summarize Matthew Hutson’s _Atlantic_ article, “[Beyond the Five Senses](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/07/beyond-the-five-senses/528699/)” (found at www.theatlantic.com) an introduction for that summary might look something like this:
" In his July 2017 article in _The Atlantic_, “Beyond the Five Senses,” Matthew Hutson explores ways in which potential technologies might expand our sensory perception of the world. He notes that some technologies, such as cochlear implants, are already accomplishing a version of this for people who do not have full access to one of the five senses. In much of the article, though, he seems more interested in how technology might expand the ways in which we sense things. Some of these technologies are based in senses that can be seen in nature, such as echolocation, and others seem more deeply rooted in science fiction. However, all of the examples he gives consider how adding new senses to the ones we already experience might change how we perceive the world around us."
