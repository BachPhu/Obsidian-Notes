# Personal Review

## <mark class="hltr-light-purple">Visual</mark>     ✦✦✦✦✦
They did a great job with the visual aspect, I think that's one of the reason why I like the movie. Started out with a country side setting was a nice move as it indeed grabbed my attention to the movie. Some of the scene that absolute mesmerize were: the blue flower field, the shooting stars, the firework from drone, the golden fall, telephone booth (in both Drop and Roma/Toto), the flooded forest, Drop finding the drone , ect...

## <mark class="hltr-purple">Story</mark>     ✦✦✦✧✧
The overall plot was not bad, nothing too special but the movie did able to get their theme across. The main theme seem to be Friendship, Courage Chasing Your Dream, Human Connection with Nature. The movie started nice. Personal preference, for most of the time I don't like when they put a foreshadow in the beginning but it doesn't bother me much anyway. For most of time, the story is pretty calm and I kinda don't mind that. Maybe just me (saw some reviews and people didn't seem to like the plot lol.) Mid movie, nothing happen much. My favorite part was a bit toward the end, probably after the trio found the drone til the end of the movie. Probably tear up or cry like 3 times ;)

## <mark class="hltr-orange">Characters</mark>

### Dialogue     ✦✦✧✧✧
I don't know how to feel about the inspiration quotes dialogue that the characters kept dropping left and right lol. I think they tried to make it deep but it just didn't feel so. In the end, it's coming from a Coming of Age story so i guess. Again, they got their message across: chase your dream and value your friendship. 
### Relationship     ✦✦✦✦✧ 
The relationship three character (Drop, Toto, Soma) was really nice throughout the movie. It quite unrealistic but that's what make it enjoyable to watch, it's the goal of friendship lol. I like that Soma and Toto would travel out to Iceland immediately after discover the location of the treasure that Drop left on Coke bottles (They took Drop's scooter with them too ;) )


## <mark class="hltr-blue">Music/ Track </mark>    ✦✦✦✦✦
The track was really good and fitting throughout scenes. Quite like the ending track. Twinkle Little Star was fun to hear too. Maybe because I haven't watch much of the the new anime but the producer of this one seem to be creative with different music genre throughout the movie. Overall, can't complain.

## <mark class="hltr-red">Favorite Scence</mark>

### The firework from their drone
### Drop finding the telephone booth
### Drop's death and Soma torn down their base

### Soma and Toto finding telephone booth and the truth
