# Personal Review

## <mark class="hltr-l-green">Summary Thought</mark>

### First Expression 
This game was one of the first games that immediately caught my attention during my first browse on itch.io. From the cover art to the name, it was simply calling my curiosity. It was a nice surprise to see the review art of the game, it seems to be an artist that I saw before and just I know that it would be one of those beautiful abstract story that I need to try.

### After Play
It was definitely a unique, pleasant experience, a little bittersweet to say. As I said earlier, it seems to be an abstract piece of work but it does feel personal too, like every details in this game was made with care and love from the creators.

## <mark class="hltr-yellow">Art</mark>
I want devour it, inject it into my system, put it on an altar, idk man it's that good. Every piece was just too gorgeous, is it even real. Just looking at the arts stir up a ling of sadness or gloomy while it's obviously not and idk why. I want to cry.

## <mark class="hltr-purple">Character & Story</mark>
- First, characters. I saw three main name, Yuna, Suzu and Vista. I dont know much of Vista and I think that could be a program Suzu created to have someone or something to talk since she don't leave her lab. But the main two is definitely Yuna and Suzu. Both their design and personality was really interesting and beautiful. 
- The story was quite sad even though most of their dialogue were so unserious lol. That part were Suzu said that the airport security stop her because the x-ray show that she has unusual anatomy and when she said that she's trans, they still have to perform a protocol check. At that point onward, the story just get gloomier. A storm without rain, or smth like what she said.  

## <mark class="hltr-blue">Music</mark>
The music and sound design just elevate the game's experience, it bring everything together. Especially the track at the end of the game.
