# 8.5 Drawing Lewis Structures of Molecular Compounds and Ions

1. Determine the total number of valence electrons in the molecule or ion.  
- neutral molecule  
- Ions  
	- If it is an anion, add one electron for each negative charge.  
	- If it is a cation, subtract one electron for each positive charge.  

2. Arrange symbols of elements to show how atoms are bonded together and connect them with  single bonds (one electron pair). Keep track of the electrons.  
- central atom- greatest bonding capacity or the least electronegative atom (except H)  

1. Complete the octet of atoms (except hydrogen) bonded to a central atom by adding lone pairs of electrons. Keep track of the electrons.  
2. Compare number of valence electrons in the Lewis structure with the number determined in step 1.  
3. Place any remaining electrons on the central atom.  
4. If there are not enough electrons to give the central atom an octet, rearrange the electrons of  the outer atoms as needed to give multiple bonds(double or triple) to complete the octet.

_Giving Multiple Bonds_: If there are not enough electrons to give the central atom  
an octet, try multiple bonds

---
- For charged ions, enclose the structure in the square parenthesis  
and put the charge on the top  
- For molecules with multiple carbon atoms, bond carbon atoms one  
to the other first and then distribute the remaining atoms.  
- Write the names of the Electron geometry; and Molecular Geometry  
- All atoms must have octet shown (except for H)
