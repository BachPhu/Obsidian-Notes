# 4.1 Displacement and Velocity Vectors

> [!Learning Objectives]
> - Calculate position vectors in a multidimensional displacement problem.
>  - Solve for the displacement in two or three dimensions.
> - Calculate the velocity vector given the position vector as a function of time.
> - Calculate the average velocity in multiple dimensions

## Displacement Vector

- In three-dimensions, the position vector is comprised from the individual components:
$$\vec{r}(t)= x(t) \hat{i} + y(t)\hat{j} + z(t)\hat{k}$$
- The displacement vector is the change between the position vector at two times
$$\Delta \vec{r} = \vec{r}(t_{2})- \vec{r}(t_{1})$$
